####simple linear regression (manual calculation)####

###data
x = [7,10,15,23,6,23,24,17,16,2]
y = [10,12,22,27,14,28,32,27,20,10]

###descriptive statistic calculations
##mean values for predictor and outcome variables
x_mean = mean(x)
y_mean = mean(y)

##deviation scores
#x deviation scores
x_dev = x - x_mean
#y deviation scores
y_dev = y - y_mean
#x deviation scores squared
x_dev2 = []
for i in x_dev push!(x_dev2, i ^ 2) end
#y deviation scores squared
y_dev2 = []
for i in y_dev push!(y_dev2, i ^ 2) end
#product of x deviation and y deviation scores
xy_dev = []
for i in 1:length(x_dev) push!(xy_dev, x_dev[i]*y_dev[i]) end

###estimating the coefficients
#slope
b1 = sum(xy_dev)/sum(x_dev2)
#intercept
b0 = y_mean - (b1 * x_mean)

###evaluating the model
##predicted values and error
#predicted values based on the estimated coefficients
y_pred = []
for i in x push!(y_pred, b0 + (b1 * i)) end
#residuals: difference between the observed outcome scores and the predicted values
residuals = []
for i in 1:length(y) push!(residuals, y[i] - y_pred[i]) end
#residuals squared
residuals2 = []
for i in residuals push!(residuals2, i ^ 2) end
#model error
model_error = y_pred = y_mean
#model error squared
model_error2 = []
for i in model_error push!(model_error2, i ^ 2) end
