6:06 and Bill Clinton admitted the other day 6:09 that it's a crazy system and I've been 6:13 saying this for years and Bill Clinton 6:15 suffered last week he made that 6:19 statement and he actually told the truth 6:21 he had a rough evening i want to tell 6:23 you that I've been talking about how 6:28 it's not gonna work before it was even 6:30 passed and it was a past if you remember 6:34 it was passed with a big lie 6:36 28 times keep your plan keep your doctor 6:39 over and over and over and we have a 6:43 real mess on our hands where the cost is 6:45 going up seventy two percent 78% next 6:49 year will be over a hundred percent it's 6:51 a disaster 6:53 we've got to repeal it replace it it's 6:55 no good 6:56 our president is incompetent believe me 6:59 he is incompetent 7:05 and every time I see him lately he's 7:06 campaigning for crooked Hillary he 7:09 shouldn't be campaigning he ought to be 7:11 working on the border 7:13 he ought to be working on illegal 7:14 immigration he would be working on 7:17 bringing our jobs back from Mexico and 7:20 all of these places that have taken our 7:22 jobs is a disaster very importantly 7:27 we're going to get our economy growing 7:30 again and growing fast my economic 7:36 agenda can be sent and you know this and 7:40 I think you've heard us we want an 7:42 agenda that really is represented by 7:45 what three words 7:47 go ahead jobs jobs jobs and people 7:52 aren't going to take our jobs and 7:55 countries are no longer going to be 7:58 taking our jobs there will be 8:00 consequences 8:02 there will be a price to pan 8:10 and one of the hardest-hit has been the 8:13 state of Ohio manufacturing jobs your 8:17 steel jobs your miners are going to be 8:20 protected your miners are going back to 8:22 work that i can tell you 8:27 this election is a simple choice it's a 8:30 choice between putting our faith in 8:33 failed politicians and she is a failed 8:37 politician look at what she's done 8:40 everything she touches I'm gonna be very 8:44 nice turns bad see I've learned or 8:52 putting our faith in you the American 8:54 people which is what we're going to do 8:56 this is a great movement that we've 8:58 created together a movement like has 9:02 never been seen in this country a 9:05 movement like they've never ever seen in 9:09 this country 9:11 never ever seen anything like this 9:16 and in november eight we're all going 9:19 out to vote and we're going to have a 9:22 tremendous victory 9:23 I think far greater than some people are 9:26 even predicting because we're tired of 9:29 corruption and we're tired of 9:31 incompetency and that's what you get 9:33 nobody wants four more years of obama 9:37 and with Hillary Clinton it'll even be 9:39 worse 9:44 the Hillary Clinton documents released 9:47 by WikiLeaks just a little while ago 9:50 make it more clear than ever just how 9:53 much is at stake on November a the 9:58 corruption of the clips knows no limits 10:02 and we've known that for a long time 10:04 today wikileaks release new emails from 10:07 early $MONTH 2015 from Clinton campaign 10:12 staffers discussing how friendly hillary 10:16 was with attorney general Loretta Lynch 10:19 oh I'm shocked to hear that 10:25 this was only months prior to the 10:27 investigation of her illegal server and 10:31 the email server that gave foreign 10:34 governments access to our confidential 10:37 information think of this 10:41 this comes on the heels of the 10:43 disclosure of the king and you saw this 10:46 disclosure the Clinton campaign was 10:50 colluding with the State Department over 10:53 the release of her emails and 10:55 revelations that the Clinton campaign 10:57 was colluding with obama's Department of 11:00 Justice over the investigation into 11:04 Hillary's secret server 11:13 there is never been anything like what's 11:15 happening in our country we've never had 11:19 a thing like this before and it's a 11:22 disgrace and they want to be ashamed of 11:25 themselves and like I took Hillary and 11:28 told hilary the other day at the debate 11:33 which we did win quite easily i will 11:52 look she's highly overrated 11:55 believe me you know she couldn't pass 12:00 the bar exam in washington DC couldn't 12:04 pass she failed 12:06 she's an overrated person how about 12:09 during the debate i'm standing there at 12:13 my lectern not moving and she walks in 12:17 front of me right 12:19 she walks in front of 12:22 and she answers the question then she 12:25 walks right back right in front of me 12:27 and the next day i read in the 12:30 newspapers that i invaded her space to 12:33 believe me 12:38 but we have another debate coming up and 12:41 we'll do the same thing to me 12:49 yesterday new dislodges were made 12:52 showing again how Hillary Clinton's 12:55 pay-for-play works in 2010 12:59 saudia arabia was looking to buy arms 13:02 from the United States in order to get 13:04 the approval Clinton State Department 13:08 had to sign off and they couldn't get it 13:10 so what happened what did saudi arabia 13:13 do they paid bill clinton a fortune to 13:17 do a speech later that year Clinton 13:20 State Department signed off an arm deals 13:22 between the United States and Saudi 13:24 Arabia shocking shocking 13:31 Hillary bleach and deleted 33,000 emails 13:35 after not before before would be bad 13:39 after is criminal 13:41 it's criminal after a congressional 13:44 subpoena then made 13 iphones disappear 13:50 somewhere the hammer has anybody used a 13:54 hammer on their iPhone he did what 13:59 business are you in uh-huh 14:02 I don't want to ask I don't want to 14:05 she did that to cover up her crimes to 14:09 WikiLeaks documents show how the media 14:13 conspires and collaborates with Clinton 14:16 campaign including giving the questions 14:19 and answers to Hillary Clinton before 14:21 debate I don't get up 14:25 I want them 14:28 I'm angry at the Republicans they don't 14:30 get me the answers in the questions the 14:33 documents show how the DNC honestly 14:38 betrayed Bernie Sanders for burning he 14:43 sold out if you wouldn't have sold out 14:46 to the devil he would have gone down and 14:48 political history as quite an important 14:52 man but he sold out and his people are 14:56 not happy and now with all of these 14:58 emails that they're finding and all of 15:00 these documents it's not a pretty 15:02 picture for Bernie looks bad looks bad 15:05 they really did break the system and 15:07 Bernie Sanders I'll tell you they rig 15:10 versus the documents also showed the 15:13 Clinton campaign says she has no core 15:17 she has no message 15:19 what are we going to do she's got no 15:21 message 15:22 I have a message you know what the 15:24 messages make America great again 15:42 that's a good message and that's what 15:44 we're doing this for I didn't need this 15:46 folks believe me I built a great company 15:49 is having a lot of fun 15:53 this isn't fun you know many of the 15:54 people although I must say sort of is 15:57 fun but 16:00 many of the people in this room 16:03 we're making more money eighteen years 16:05 ago then they are now and they're 16:07 working harder now in many cases you 16:09 have two jobs so you're working harder 16:12 you're older and you making less but I'm 16:17 older and I'm working harder also so I 16:20 don't feel bad for anybody in the room 16:22 we're all in the same boat but it's 16:25 going to pay off because we're going to 16:27 turn our country around to turn our 16:30 country 16:37 what Hilary is instead is the hundreds 16:41 of millions of dollars she raised from 16:43 Wall Street special interest in fact the 16:46 email show Hillary has a private 16:49 position for wall street and a public 16:52 position a fraud for the voters she says 16:57 this to Wall Street she says this to the 17:00 voters the emails also reveal how the 17:03 Clintons ripped off the wonderful people 17:06 of haiti doling out favors for their 17:09 friends and special interests otra 17:16 Americans have had it with the years and 17:19 decades of clinton corruption and i will 17:23 tell you what happened with the Attorney 17:27 General of the United States 17:33 their airplane in Arizona when he was 17:37 going to be playing golf 17:39 very hot 17:41 I don't think he's gonna be playing God 17:43 just happened to meet her happened to be 17:47 on the tarmac said oh gee let's say 17:50 he'll own stayed for 39 minutes had 17:54 talked about golf and his grandchildren 17:56 he didn't talk about golf and he didn't 17:59 talk about his grandchildren less it was 18:02 a minute or two I would think he 18:06 probably talked about appointing her as 18:10 the Attorney General if Hillary wins 18:15 this election and you're not allowed to 18:19 do that and they were very embarrassed 18:22 and they thought it would be something 18:25 where they could speak on and sneak off 18:27 and I've had a plane for a long time 18:30 I've never had anybody stop it get on 18:32 come off on the tarmac does it happen 18:37 and then you have the director of the 18:39 FBI and some of the greatest people in 18:43 the world 18:46 some of the greatest people of really in 18:49 our country some of the great people are 18:51 in the FBI and based on what i read and 18:54 see and hear they are so angry at what 19:00 took place where they caught her called 19:04 she's a corrupt person she should not be 19:07 allowed to run for the presidency she's 19:10 a corrupt person 19:35 she should be locked up she sure 19:45 and if I win I am going to ask my 19:51 Attorney General to appoint a special 19:54 prosecutor to look into her crimes 19:58 because what she did is a disgrace to 20:02 the United States of America 20:10 and we're also going to look in to the 20:14 investigation in other words we're going 20:17 to investigate the investigation because 20:20 what happened is it disgrace other 20:23 people their lives have been destroyed 20:25 for doing so much less and everybody 20:30 knows you know when you delete something 20:34 or when you don't provide the documents 20:36 requested after after you get a subpoena 20:40 from the United States Congress that's a 20:42 criminal act that alone 20:45 forget about all of the other things 20:47 which are even worse in many ways but 20:50 that alone is a criminal act and now as 20:54 you heard last week two boxes of 20:58 information and emails are missing as of 21:00 last week 21:01 what are we doing folks what are we 21:04 doing what are we living with what are 21:06 we living with this will finally be the 21:12 year where the American people can say 21:16 enough is enough 21:25 the twins are the past but we are all 21:29 going to be together a very bright 21:31 future 21:37 the new emails also show members of the 21:41 Clinton team viciously attacking 21:44 Catholics and evangelicals 21:50 true 21:52 it's just the latest evidence of the 21:54 hatred that the Clinton campaign has 21:57 four faithful people in our country 22:01 faithful Americans Hillary Clinton 22:05 thinks you're deplorable and 22:09 irredeemable an irredeemable might be 22:12 worse means you can't help yourself 22:17 I call you hard-working American 22:19 patriots and together we are going to 22:21 save our country where the smartest with 22:24 the best we're going to unify our 22:26 country 22:32 these emails also revealed that Clinton 22:36 believes in global governance and 22:39 unlimited immigration into our country 22:50 speaking and secrets to a foreign back 22:53 Hillary Clinton said my dream is a 22:56 hemispheric common market they go your 22:58 jobs the rest of your jobs with open 23:02 trade and open borders 23:04 hey she didn't want to hear that she 23:07 didn't want that to get out behind 23:10 closed doors when she thought no one was 23:12 listening 23:13 she pledged to dissolve the borders of 23:15 the United States of America's what's 23:17 happening for that's what's happened 23:21 we are going to have strong borders we 23:24 are going to have a great wall 23:46 and who is going to pay for that wall 23:51 100-percent they don't know it yet but 23:56 that doesn't know now the Bexar goes 23:59 fine is I was there two months ago I met 24:03 with the President of Mexico very good 24:05 person and you know what we're gonna 24:07 have a great relationship with Mexico 24:08 but right now they're leaders are too 24:11 smart for our leaders we have massive 24:13 trade deficit with mexico they beat us 24:16 at the border they beat us with trade we 24:20 have massive trade deficit with china 24:22 they make our product and other 24:25 countries we don't make things any more 24:28 essentially what we're going to start 24:30 making things again we're going to start 24:34 making things again 24:41 we're gonna make him in ohio believe me 24:43 we're gonna make them in ohio Hillary 24:47 once and forever the American 24:49 independence that our soldiers fought 24:52 and died for to keep and protect us 24:55 either we win this election or we lose 24:59 our country and that's what's happened 25:02 that's your choice it's as simple as 25:05 that 25:05 a trump administration will secure and 25:09 defend our borders Hillary is so radical 25:18 and immigration as Secretary of State 25:21 she refused to make foreign countries 25:24 take back their criminal aliens i don't 25:27 know if you know what's going on 25:29 they would catch a murderer they would 25:31 catch a drug lord they would catch some 25:35 bad people top gang members they bring 25:39 them back into their countries the 25:41 countries would say very intelligently 25:43 we don't want them so we bring them back 25:47 he would put no pressure of those 25:49 countries we bring them back and in many 25:52 cases we just put it right back in our 25:54 streets where they wreaked havoc wreaked 25:57 havoc 26:01 I 26:03 I will get them over there and they're 26:06 not coming back I promise you that 26:08 promise promise for that one such killer 26:14 was set free on Hillary's watch went on 26:17 to kill a young American girl named 26:21 casey chadwin the killer had already 26:24 been convicted for shooting a girl in 26:26 the head should have been sent home and 26:29 should have never been here in the first 26:30 place instead he was set free went on a 26:36 rampage and murdered cases Hillary 26:41 Clinton should be ashamed she should be 26:45 a shame she also wants to increase 26:50 Syrian refugees coming into our country 26:54 by five hundred and fifty percent 27:01 this even though she admitted in private 27:05 according to WikiLeaks just the other 27:07 day that she knows terrorists are trying 27:10 to infiltrate the refugee program which 27:15 they absolutely are 27:17 Hillary support for open borders with 27:22 the Middle East will give us the same 27:25 problems as France all you have to do is 27:27 look on see what's happening with 27:29 Germany and so many other countries with 27:34 the multi-generational terrorism 27:36 embedded in our communities all over all 27:40 over the world and all over our country 27:42 so let me state this as clearly and as 27:47 nicely as i can i am going to keep 27:50 radical Islamic terrorists the hell out 27:55 of our contract 28:13 at the same time we're going to 28:15 completely rebuild our very depleted 28:19 military that includes building a 28:22 state-of-the-art missile defenses in 28:25 which we need it's time 28:27 when it comes to keeping America safe i 28:32 believe in three very important words 28:35 and we don't have it now it's called 28:37 peace through strength 28:44 but to be a strong country we must also 28:49 be a rich country sounds crass but we 28:53 got to be a rich country right now we're 28:55 a poor country where a debtor nation at 28:59 the center of our economic revival will 29:03 be fixing our terrible horrible 29:06 incompetently negotiated trade deals in 29:14 our country 47 million Americans are in 29:18 poverty and 45 million Americans are on 29:22 food stamps amazing right 29:25 in this day and age this is the legacy 29:28 of President Obama and Hillary Clinton 29:31 no state has been hurt worse by our 29:37 trade deals that the state of Ohio i'm 29:41 going to bring back here jobs you're 29:44 going to have big expansion of your 29:46 existing companies and no more companies 29:49 are going to leave the state of Ohio 29:52 without there being serious economic 29:55 consequences for that company 30:08 the state of Ohio has lost one and three 30:10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA signed by 30:14 bill clinton and supported heavily by 30:16 hillary clinton hillary South Korea deal 30:19 also cost the united states another 30:21 hundred thousand jobs and you remember 30:24 when Hillary Clinton ran for the senate 30:26 in New York she said she was gonna bring 30:28 back 200,000 jobs to upstate New York 30:32 guess what 30:34 more and more and more companies left 30:36 they went to Mexico and other places she 30:39 did nothing but talk and that's all 30:41 she's doing now when she runs for 30:43 president 30:44 she doesn't have the strength she 30:47 doesn't have the aptitude she doesn't 30:50 have what it takes if we're going to be 30:52 a great country again that i can tell 30:55 you one hundred percent 31:08 and you know what she's over in China if 31:12 she goes down in Tiananmen Square 31:15 they'll just leave her there they're 31:17 tough people just gonna leave her there 31:21 they're not gonna help her up they'll 31:23 say letter come up when she's ready 31:26 he's a tough people since China entered 31:30 the World Trade Organization another 31:32 bill and hillary back deal 31:34 now listen to this 70,000 factors i 31:39 thought they meant 500-700 7070 thousand 31:46 factories have shut down or left the 31:50 United States of America 70,000 31:55 that's 15 factory's closing a day on 31:59 average in our country going to other 32:02 places we are living through the 32:05 greatest jobs theft in the history of 32:09 the world and it comes from our country 32:12 and goes to many others in particular 32:14 China Mexico Japan but plenty of 32:19 companies like carrier general electric 32:23 motor all the town 32:26 fiat-chrysler and so many others are 32:28 moving their jobs to Mexico and now for 32:32 just announced its moving all of its 32:35 small car production to Mexico also not 32:38 good not good 32:41 and I will tell you this if I win when 32:46 Ford when carrier when these companies 32:50 announced that they want to leave fire 32:52 all of their American workers and go to 32:54 Mexico and in the case of Fort build a 32:57 two-million-dollar plant i will tell you 32:59 what's going to happen we will tell them 33:03 congratulations enjoy your new plant but 33:06 every time you make an air conditioning 33:08 unit or a small car or a big car or a 33:12 big truck and you want to send it into 33:15 the United States you're gonna have a 33:18 35-percent tax to pay and are now 33:20 stronger and they'll never move pops 33:26 will never move and if they do move 33:29 that's okay too because we're gonna make 33:31 a fortune 33:32 now a lot of politicians aren't smart 33:35 enough to understand that and many do 33:38 understand it but they're taking care of 33:40 the companies that are moving 33:41 description but they will not move and 33:47 the ones that do move will pay a big 33:49 price but when they hear this 33:52 they're not moving it's very simple and 33:55 in cleveland right now and throughout 33:59 Ohio you have companies negotiating to 34:03 move some of you work in those companies 34:07 and many of the people that work at 34:11 those companies are here now and you 34:13 don't even know the owners and the 34:16 leaders of the company are negotiating 34:19 but with me you don't have to worry 34:21 about it because we will make it 34:23 economically very difficult for them to 34:26 leave the United States political to 34:29 your afterward if I win day one we're 34:34 going to announce our plans to totally 34:36 renegotiate the worst trade deal ever 34:40 made 34:40 NAFTA 34:42 if we don't get what we want to that 34:45 renegotiation we will leave me after and 34:49 start over and get ultimately a much 34:52 much better trade deal we will also stop 34:58 the trans-pacific partnership the deal 35:01 Hillary Clinton lied about during the 35:03 debate when she called it the gold 35:06 standard and during the debate 35:09 never said that she lied she live and 35:14 she lied about the line in the sand 35:16 remember she said no I never said that i 35:19 was in secretary of state when obama 35:23 made that stupid pledge line in the sand 35:26 that he didn't honor just like some 35:32 people didn't honor the pledge to Donald 35:37 Trump when we all ran for the Republican 35:40 nomination there were a few people that 35:44 did not honor the pledge I would have 35:48 honored my pledge but some people are so 35:51 badly they'll never forget it so i guess 35:53 they couldn't handle it 35:55 we are going to start making things 35:57 again in America we are going to have 36:00 apple and many companies like Apple 36:03 start making their iphones and their 36:07 products in the United States not in 36:09 Vietnam and China and every place but 36:13 here 36:15 as part of our plan to bring back our 36:17 jobs 36:19 we're going to lower our business acts 36:21 from 35% to fifteen percent right now 36:25 with the highest in the world 36:27 we're going to be one of the lowest our 36:32 businesses are being forced out we can't 36:34 let it happen wages will rise jobs will 36:37 return and factories will come rushing 36:40 onto our sure we're also going to fix 36:44 our inner cities and help African 36:48 American and Hispanic Americans who are 36:51 being treated very very unfairly 36:58 forty-five percent of african-american 37:01 you live in poverty 37:04 fifty-eight percent of african-american 37:08 is don't have jobs more than 3,000 37:12 people have been shot
