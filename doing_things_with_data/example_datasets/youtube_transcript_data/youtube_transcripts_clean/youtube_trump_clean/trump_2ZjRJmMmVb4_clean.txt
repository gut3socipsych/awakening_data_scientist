goldman sachs sharing a 4:00 private position then lies to you the 4:04 public with her public position and by 4:07 the way WikiLeaks just came out with 4:10 lots of really unbelievable things just 4:13 minutes ago fact I almost delayed this 4:19 speech by about two hours it's so 4:20 interesting but I decided you're more 4:23 important than anybody 4:25 it's all a big beautiful fraud Hillary 4:32 Clinton deleted 33,000 emails after a 4:36 congressional subpoena that's after a 4:40 club where after she got a congressional 4:44 subpoena she deleted 33 that doesn't 4:47 email she lied to congress under of she 4:51 made 13 iphones disappear some with a 4:54 hammer and now we're learning two boxes 4:57 of email evidence and other things are 5:00 mysteriously missing the WikiLeaks 5:06 documents show that the Clinton campaign 5:09 was colluding directly with the 5:11 Department of State and justice to the 5:13 investigation and on the investigation 5:15 of our emails and her illegal server 5:19 that put our national security at grave 5:23 risk Hillary Clinton should have been 5:26 prosecuted and gone to jail for what 5:46 the FBI and the Department of Justice 5:50 created a fraud in allowing Hillary 5:53 Clinton to get away with her terrible 5:56 terrible crimes and I guarantee you that 6:01 Clinton's are laughing at them right now 6:06 the directors performance in Congress 6:09 coupled with Bill Clinton's clandestine 6:11 meeting on the tarmac 6:15 which takes about three minutes out of 6:19 the 39 minutes is one of the lowest 6:23 points in the history of the Justice 6:26 Department and in the history of the FBI 6:29 instead of being held accountable 6:35 hilary is running for president and what 6:38 looks like too many people a totally 6:41 rigged election the election is being 6:46 rigged by corrupted media pushing false 6:49 allegations and outright lies in an 6:52 effort to elect Hillary Clinton 6:55 President but we are going to stop it 7:00 we are not going to back down 7:09 false stories all made up lies lies know 7:16 what this is no nothing 7:19 all big lies it's a rigged system and 7:25 they take these lies and they put them 7:27 on front pages 7:28 this is a rigged system folks but we're 7:31 not going to let it happen 7:32 we're not gonna let it happen 7:38 we are seeing what's going on we've only 7:41 just begun to fight 7:43 Americans have had it with the years and 7:46 decades of clinton corruption and that's 7:48 what it is you go back to white water or 7:51 the cattle by you remember the cattle by 7:53 they cattle by what a disgrace that was 7:57 this will finally be the year the 8:00 american people say enough is enough 8:03 enough is enough 8:09 speaking in secret to a foreign bank 8:11 Hillary Clinton said her dream is for 8:14 total open trade and open borders there 8:18 go the rest of your jobs there go the 8:21 rest of your jobs 8:23 Hillary and Bill raise millions of 8:25 dollars from global interest groups who 8:27 have no allegiance to our country or our 8:30 workers whatsoever they couldn't care 8:32 less by open trade she means foreign 8:35 countries can cheat us out of millions 8:37 of jobs and trillions and trillions of 8:40 dollars by open borders she means 8:43 totally unlimited immigration pouring 8:46 into our country either we win the 8:52 election or we lose the country and this 8:55 is the last time we have this is it 8:59 november eight this is it we can either 9:01 win or we're gonna have a whole 9:03 different country and it's never going 9:06 to come back never comes back 9:22 Hillary's plan includes an open border 9:25 with the Middle East meaning generations 9:29 of radicalism within our shores 9:32 she refuses to mention the term radical 9:36 Islamic terrorism Obama refuses to use 9:41 that term unless you're going to define 9:44 a problem you're never going to solve it 9:46 and she will never solve it if you 9:48 remember Isis came out of a vacuum while 9:50 she was Secretary of State came right 9:53 out of a vacuum in Iraq the way they got 9:56 out that have never been in the war in 9:58 the first place but we were but the way 10:01 they got out was disgraceful and ice is 10:04 formed and now she's saying i will be 10:07 choices so Isis started from nothing and 10:13 now they're in 32 different countries 10:17 way to go Hillary great job everything 10:20 she touches turns bad just take a look 10:23 at our record every single and if she's 10:26 president this country is going to go 10:28 for a ride downward like we've never 10:30 seen it before more years of an 10:33 incompetent president barack obama was 10:36 an incompetent president it'll be four 10:39 more years of an incompetent president 10:43 how about the Iran deal where they gave 10:50 them four hundred million and cares 10:52 about that but but the 400 million 10:57 wasn't 400 million it was 1.7 billion in 11:01 cash that would fill up the side of the 11:05 arena of these people how about the 800 11:09 people bad ones that were going to be 11:11 deported you know to be deported from 11:13 this country you gotta be bad because we 11:16 don't deport you gotta be bad so they'd 11:18 hundred people going to be deported but 11:22 they made a mistake and they became 11:25 United States citizens instead made a 11:27 mistake 11:28 now why did they make that mistake folks 11:31 you know in Maine I have great friends 11:34 and made their very streetwise even 11:37 though you have the most beautiful 11:37 surroundings probably in the world 11:40 they're very streetwise you really do 11:43 you also have a big plot i'll end up 11:46 here i'll tell you but but they're very 11:49 streetwise very smart people my friends 11:51 are very smart people so why do you 11:54 think the 800 people went from being 11:55 deported into being citizens you know 12:01 what that is ok but they were wrong 12:04 because it was an 800 turned out to be 12:07 1800 ok citizens so I said undo it undo 12:14 it 12:15 they said well that wouldn't be 12:17 constitutional how stupid away hey how 12:20 stupid are we have stupid our way we 12:24 have not anymore you're right 12:28 not anymore 12:29 that stuff won't be happening I promise 12:32 you she wants us to follow the path of 12:34 France Germany and import terrorism 12:37 directly into the United States so with 12:41 all of the people coming in 12:43 we're gonna have problems like you 12:45 wouldn't believe you just watch and she 12:47 wants five hundred and fifty percent 12:49 more coming in from Syria than the 12:52 thousands and thousands that our 12:55 president quote president has coming in 12:59 so let me state this as clearly as I can 13:02 if I'm elected president I'm going to 13:05 keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell 13:10 out of this country 13:30 we love our country will all be America 13:33 first America first we will also stop 13:36 the crisis of illegal immigration a 13:40 trump administration will secure and 13:43 defend our borders and yes we will build 13:52 the wall 13:58 and Mexico will pay for the wall 14:05 100 14:06 100 14:10 we have the first-ever endorsement from 14:13 our ice and Border Patrol officers and 14:16 agents first-ever first time they've 14:18 ever endorsed the presidential candidate 14:20 and both the border patrol agents and 14:24 ice have just done it I said it last 14:26 week it was just reported that a man 14:29 deported from our country 10 times in 14:32 six years has been charged with the 14:35 raping of a twelve-year-old girl in 14:38 August texas police arrested a serial 14:41 illegal immigrant rapist who had been 14:43 deported five times his victims include 14:45 a 68 year old woman with a cane who took 14:50 her his offer to drive and look she 14:53 wanted to drive home took the offer to 14:56 have a drive home he left her on the 14:59 side of a dirt road 15:01 what kind of a government allows its own 15:04 people to suffer like what's up Frank 15:08 and were suffering crime after crime 15:11 horror show after horror show and we're 15:14 gonna have very strong borders and we're 15:16 gonna have the wall but we're gonna have 15:17 people come into our country we have to 15:19 but they're gonna come in to our country 15:21 legally legally they're going to come in 15:25 legal as Secretary of State Hillary 15:30 Clinton allowed thousands and thousands 15:33 of criminal aliens to be released 15:35 because their home countries wouldn't 15:37 take them back that's because their home 15:39 countries are smart 15:41 I promise you don't want they have a 15:44 killer they want to bring them back to a 15:47 certain country the countries we don't 15:49 want him we're not taking them turn your 15:51 playing around get out of here 15:53 we're not taking your not landing you 15:55 not get out of here 15:57 Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State 16:00 she said ok we'll take I promise you 16:03 that won't happen once not once those 16:07 countries are taken 16:08 our people drug lords gang members those 16:12 countries are taking those people back 16:14 among those she allowed to go for free 16:17 was a criminal aliens who had previously 16:20 been convicted for shooting a girl in 16:22 the head after his release he viciously 16:26 murdered a young girl named casey 16:29 Chadwick in Connecticut you probably 16:31 read about it a wall will not only keep 16:35 out criminals but it will also keep out 16:38 the drugs and heroin from pouring into 16:41 Maine and poisoning your youth and I 16:49 just left New Hampshire and like to 16:51 Hampshire you have a tremendous drug bro 16:54 drug overdoses in Maine are on at a 16:58 record pace 17:00 I've outlined today a detailed plan to 17:02 stop the opioid crisis my plan begins 17:05 with a strong border 17:09 it includes the prosecution of drug 17:11 dealers and dramatically expands access 17:13 to life-saving treatments that will help 17:17 people 17:17 unchained themselves from this terrible 17:20 terrible and very hard to get rid of 17:23 addiction and there are ways of doing 17:26 but if we're going to bring back hope 17:30 the suffering Americans we must also 17:33 solve our jobs and economic crisis 17:37 because we have a tremendous jobs crisis 17:39 so many of our jobs have gone to Mexico 17:42 have gone to places like China indirect 17:46 on airports the state of Maine has lost 17:49 nearly one in three manufacturing job 17:52 since NAFTA signed by bill clinton and 17:55 supported by crooked Hillary since China 17:58 ended the World Trade Organization 18:00 another bill clinton disaster also 18:03 backed by Hillary 70,000 and I thought 18:08 this was a typographical error as he 18:11 can't be 70,000 we went back at 70,000 I 18:15 thought 7700 must be a mistake 70,000 18:21 factories have shut down or left the 18:25 United States as you know as you know 18:29 that's 15 factory's closing a day on 18:33 average can you believe it 15 a day in 18:35 the country 18:36 we're living through the greatest jobs 18:39 left in the history of the world 18:41 what's happened to our country it is the 18:44 greatest jobs theft in the history of 18:47 the world there's never been a thing 18:49 like happened to our country and i will 18:54 stop it if I win day one 18:58 we're going to announce our plans to 19:02 totally renegotiate the disaster known 19:06 as that after if we don't get at the 19:13 deal we want we'll even after and start 19:18 over again and make much better trade 19:21 deals i like trade time for trade up for 19:24 free trade but it has to also be fair 19:28 trade but I'm for trade where things 19:31 benefit our country 19:33 we got unemployment and we get drugs 19:37 they get can we go to get John Wigan 19:40 practice will leave me halfway and wolf 19:42 up and start over again and make much 19:45 better trades i like going to start 19:48 raining I think that's reiterate my 19:50 mother has stopped to be fair trial of 19:52 our plant but I'm forget where they 19:54 spent going all around everywhere job is 19:56 going back 30 powercenter faulty percent 19:59 we wanted to weigh highway not a one-way 20:01 right now we have a one-way highway 20:03 right into Mexico we get unemployment 20:06 and we get drugs they get cash they get 20:09 jobs and they get factories not going to 20:11 be that way anymore fup we're going to 20:16 start making things again in America as 20:19 part of our plan to bring back our jobs 20:22 were going to lower business tax from 20:23 thirty-five percent of fifteen percent 20:25 which is almost getting to be the record 20:29 low and by the way 35% major countries 20:33 35% the highest anywhere in the world we 20:38 will lower taxes massively and all 20:40 Americans Hillary will raise taxes and 20:42 raise your taxes by a lot that's what 20:45 she she plans to do just take a look 20:48 our biggest reductions will be for the 20:51 working and middle-class this includes 20:54 letting parents deduct the cost of 20:56 childcare Reagan's tax cuts in the 20:59 eighties and Kennedy's tax cuts in the 21:01 sixties brought us tremendous growth my 21:04 economic reforms on taxes trade 21:07 regulation and American energy will 21:09 produce at least 25 million jobs over 21:12 the next decade 21:14 it's the most pro-growth economic plan 21:17 in American history and it's gotten some 21:20 wonderful reviews 21:21 we're also going to protect the right of 21:24 people and the people of Maine to use 21:27 their own land you know what we're 21:30 talking about 21:36 President Obama with the support of 21:39 politicians like Hillary Clinton issued 21:42 an executive order two months ago making 21:44 over 87,000 acres in Maine into a new 21:48 national monument 21:52 that's a lot of acres I'll tell you no 21:55 consideration was made for local 21:58 concerns impacts and jobs or the main 22:02 forestry sector which is such an 22:04 important sister like so important for 22:08 you and nobody even thought of it 22:10 nobody even thought they don't care 22:11 about you no approval by Congress your 22:15 state legislature totally opposed it 22:17 it's just another federal outreach 22:19 that's going to do much more harm much 22:22 much more harm than it is good and it's 22:25 made a lot of people in Maine very angry 22:27 because the people of Maine have great 22:29 common-sense give me a break what do 22:30 they do 22:31 obama and clinton don't care that this 22:38 area badly needs jobs and growth and 22:41 that this decision done at the stroke of 22:43 a pen without the support of the local 22:45 community undermines the people that 22:48 live and work right here in Maine that's 22:51 a bad bad
