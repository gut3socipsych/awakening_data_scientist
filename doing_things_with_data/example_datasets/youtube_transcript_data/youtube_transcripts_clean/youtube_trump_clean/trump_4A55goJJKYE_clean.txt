0:00 thank you everybody thank you so much i greatly appreciated and I'd like to 0:06 thank the owner of the plan Gloria you're here someplace 0:10 here someplace thank you i want to thank Rick Santorum or senator or more 0:14 separate senator for being here and for the endorsement we really appreciate it 0:18 and I have to say I was the advancing workers tapes at the most support the 0:24 amazing workers and I know you've been through some very very tough times but 0:30 we're going to make it better and we're going to get better fast ok just watch 0:37 so today I'm going to talk about how to make America wealthy again have to do it 0:47 with 30 miles from steel city 0:52 Pittsburgh played a central role in building our nation 0:57 the legacy of Pennsylvania steel workers lives in the bridges railways and 1:02 skyscrapers that make up our great American landscape but our work is 1:09 loyalty was repaid you know it better than anybody with total betrayal our 1:16 politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization moving our jobs 1:23 our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas globalization is made the 1:29 financial elite who donate to politicians very very wealthy 1:35 I used to be one of them 1:39 hate to say it but I used to be one but it's left millions of our workers with 1:46 nothing but poverty and heartache 1:49 when subsidized foreign steel is dumped into our markets threatening our 1:55 factories the politicians have proven folks have proven they do nothing for 2:02 years they watched on the sidelines as our jobs vanished and our communities 2:07 were plunged into depression level unemployment 2:12 many of these areas have still never recovered and never will unless I become 2:18 president 2:22 then they're gonna recover fast our politicians took away from the people 2:29 there means of making a living and supporting their families skilled 2:34 craftsmen and trades people and factory workers have seen the jobs they love 2:40 shipped thousands and thousands of miles away 2:45 many Pennsylvania towns once thriving and humming are now in a state of total 2:51 disrepair 2:53 this wave of globalization has wiped out totally totally our middle class 3:00 it doesn't have to be this way we can turn it around and we can turn it around 3:05 fast 3:14 but if we're going to deliver real change we are going to have to reject 3:18 the campaign of fear and intimidation being pursued by powerful corporations 3:23 media elites and political dynasties the people who rigged the system for their 3:30 benefit will do anything and say anything to keep things exactly the way 3:36 they are the people who rigged the system are supporting Hillary Clinton 3:43 because they know as long as she is in charge 3:47 nothing's going to change the inner cities will remain poor the factories 3:53 will remain closed the borders will remain open the special interest will 4:00 remain firmly in control 4:02 Hillary Clinton and her friends and global finance want to scare American to 4:07 thinking small and they want to scare American people out of voting for the 4:13 better future and you have a great future folks you have a great future 4:17 these people have given her tens of millions of dollars 4:21 my campaign has the absolute opposite message I want you to imagine a much 4:32 better life and a life where you can believe in the American dream again 4:39 right now you can't do that 4:43 ok 4:49 I want you to imagine how much better a future can be if we declare independence 4:54 from the elites who read us from one financial and foreign policy disaster to 5:01 another our friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their 5:07 economy politics and borders 5:15 yeah 5:16 I was on the right side of that issue as you know with the people i was there i 5:21 said it was going to happen i felt it 5:24 while Hilary has always stood with the elites and both she and President Obama 5:30 predicted that one and many others 5:34 totally wrong 5:39 now it's time for the American people to take back their future gonna take it 5:45 back 5:51 that's the choice we face we can either give into Hillary Clinton's campaign 5:57 fear or we can choose to believe again in American very sadly we lost our way 6:12 when we stopped believing in our country America became the world's dominant 6:17 economy by becoming the world's dominant producer you know that from right here 6:23 right in this plant 6:31 the wealth is created we shared broadly creating the biggest middle class the 6:36 world has ever known 6:38 but then America changed his policy from promoting development in America in in 6:45 in America to promoting development in other nations 6:52 that's what's happening and that's what's happened we allowed foreign 6:56 countries to subsidize their goods devalue their currencies violate their 7:02 agreements and cheat in every way imaginable and our politicians did 7:08 nothing about it 7:09 trillions of our dollars and millions of our jobs 7:13 float overseas as a result i have visited cities and towns across this 7:19 country where a third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out 7:25 in the last 20 years 7:28 today we import nearly 800 billion more in goods then we export can't continue 7:36 to do that 7:37 this is not some natural disaster 7:41 it's a political and politician made disaster very simple and it can be 7:48 corrected and we can correct it fast 7:51 when we have people with the right thinking right up here it is the 7:56 consequence 7:59 yeah 8:03 it is the consequence of a leadership class that worships globalism over 8:08 Americanism 8:09 this is a direct affront to our founding fathers who America wanted to be strong 8:15 they wanted this country to be strong and they wanted to be independent and 8:20 they wanted it to be free 8:30 our founding fathers understood trade much better than our current politicians 8:37 believe me 8:38 George Washington said that the promotion of domestic manufacturing will 8:49 be among the first consequences to flow from an energetic government 8:54 Alexander Hamilton spoke frequently of the Expediency of encouraging 9:00 manufacturing in in in the United States 9:14 and listen to this the first Republican President Abraham Lincoln warned that 9:20 quote the abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will 9:29 produce want and ruin among our people he understood it much better than our 9:35 current politicians 9:37 that's why he was Abraham Lincoln I guess 9:46 our original Constitution did not even have an income tax 9:50 instead it had terrorist emphasizing taxation of foreign not domestic 9:57 production yet today 10:00 240 years after the Revolution 10:04 we've turned things completely upside down 10:08 we tax and regulate and restrict our companies to death and then we allow 10:14 foreign countries that sheep to export their goods to us tax free 10:22 how stupid is this how can it happen 10:27 how stupid is that 10:33 as a result we have become more dependent on foreign countries than ever 10:38 before 10:39 ladies and gentlemen it's time to declare our economic independence 10:45 once again that means 10:52 ok 10:56 that means voting for Donald Trump 11:02 yeah 11:03 I'll do it no doubt about it not even a little doubt it also means reversing two 11:09 of the worst legacies of the Clinton years America has lost nearly one-third 11:15 of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 even as the country has increased his 11:21 population think of this by 50 million people at the center of this catastrophe 11:27 are to trade deals push by Bill and Hillary Clinton 11:31 first the north american free trade agreement or the disaster called NAFTA 11:39 second 11:41 China's entry into the World Trade Organization NAFTA was the worst trade 11:47 deal in the history 11:48 it's like the history of this country and China's entrance into the world 11:53 trade organization has enabled the greatest job theft in the history of our 12:00 country 12:01 it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA people don't remember in 1993 and 12:09 Hillary Clinton who supported it and the havoc that it reached after he left 12:16 office was on believable 12:19 it was also built Clinton who lobbied for China's disasters entry into the 12:26 World Trade Organization and Hillary Clinton who backed that terrible 12:31 terrible agreement then as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stood by idly 12:37 while China cheated on its currency added another trillion dollars to our 12:43 trade deficits and stall hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual 12:50 property 12:52 yeah 12:58 and I've been talking about China for many years and you know what 13:02 nobody listened but they're listening now that i can tell you 13:12 the city of Pittsburgh and the state of Pennsylvania have lost one third of 13:17 their manufacturing jobs since that Clinton's put china into the WTO fifty 13:25 thousand factories across America have shut their doors in that time and this 13:32 factory because of your great owners gave and Gloria it's hanging in hanging 13:38 in 13:38 but they just told me it's not easy almost half of our entire manufacturing 13:45 trade deficit in goods with the world is a result and it's the result of trade 13:51 with China 13:53 it was also Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State who shoved does into a 13:57 job-killing deal with South Korea as reported by the economic policy 14:04 institute in may this deal doubled our trade deficit with South Korea and 14:10 destroyed nearly 100,000 American jobs as Bernie Sanders said Hillary Clinton 14:18 voted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of 14:23 this country millions millions of jobs 14:31 yeah 14:35 trade reform and the negotiation of great trade deals is the quickest way to 14:41 bring our jobs back to our country 14:52 to understand why trade reform creates jobs and it creates a lot of them 14:56 we need to understand how all nations grow and prosper massive trade deficits 15:03 subtract directly from our gross domestic product from nineteen 15:09 forty-seven to 2001 a space man of over five decades our inflation adjusted 15:16 gross domestic product grew at a rate of three point five percent 15:21 however since 2002 the year after we fully opened our markets to chinese 15:27 imports that gdp growth rate has been cut in half 15:32 what does this mean for Americans not good for every one percent of gdp growth 15:40 and ready he'll give generating any given year we also failed to create over 15:45 1 million jobs 15:48 what a waste and what is said said thing 15:58 America's Got American deficit due to slower growth since 2002 is well over 20 16:05 million jobs and that's just about the number of jobs 16:10 our country needs right now to put America back to work at decent wages 16:16 wages are very low because there is no competition and they're going to go up 16:23 because we're going to thrive again as a country 16:33 the trans-pacific partnership is the greatest danger yet the TPP as it's 16:41 known would be the death blow for American manufacturing it would give up 16:48 all of our economic leverage to an international commission that would put 16:53 the interests of foreign countries above our own it would further open our 16:59 markets too aggressive currency cheaters cheaters 17:03 that's what they are cheaters they're not playing by the rules 17:07 they're cheating it would make it easier for our trading competitors to ship 17:13 cheap subsidized goods into United States Marshals while allowing foreign 17:18 countries to continue putting up barriers in front of our exports which 17:25 is what they do 17:26 it's very hard to export to their countries they make it very difficult 17:31 we on the other hand come on in everybody come on it 17:35 bad leadership the TPP would lower tariffs on foreign cars while leaving in 17:43 place to foreign practices that keep American cars from being sold overseas 17:50 that's not all mark my words china will enter the TPP through the back door and 17:56 a later date 17:57 they are watching their study they're not in it now but they're going to be in 18:01 it if it's good i'll be there by the way it's no good 18:05 they'll pass same way always is the agreement would also force American 18:11 workers to compete directly against workers from Vietnam one of the lowest 18:16 wage countries on earth 18:18 not only will the TPP undermine our economy but it will undermine our 18:23 independence 18:25 that's what's happened the TPP creates a new international commission that makes 18:32 decisions 18:33 the American people are no longer 18:36 given the right to veto these commissions are great for Hillary's Wall 18:41 Street funders who can spend 18:43 asked amounts of money to influence the people on the commissions and the 18:49 outcomes 18:50 it should be no surprise then that Hillary Clinton according to bloomberg 18:54 took a leading part in drafting the trans-pacific partnership 19:00 please remember that especially in November 19:12 she praised reports the TPP on forty five separate occasions and even called 19:18 it the gold standard 19:21 Hillary Clinton was totally for the TPP just a short while ago but when she saw 19:27 my stance which is totally against she was shamed into saying she would be 19:34 against it too and i will tell you it was the same shame that she had recently 19:41 where she was sort of forced into saying radical Islamic terrorism which he 19:48 didn't want to say but she was shamed into that but have no doubt that she 20:01 will immediately approve it 20:02 if it's put before her and that is guarantee guarantee she will do this 20:10 justice she's betrayed American workers for wall street and throughout 20:14 throughout her career her whole career she has betrayed the American work 20:20 she's trying to put on a good front now she will betray you again 20:23 her career and her husband have signed so many disasters and never ever forget 20:30 after just never ever forget it because you know what is done 20:34 I know what is done and in touring I've seen the devastation that it's left 20:39 behind 20:40 here's how it would go she would make a small token change declare the TPP pack 20:49 fixed and Ram it through and you will suffer 20:53 that's why Hillary is now only said she has problems with TP in its current form 21:01 you know that means that means like they'll make a little too word change 21:04 and she'll fix it and still feel good but she says in its current form she can 21:09 rush to embrace it again and she will at the earliest opportunity 21:13 if the media doesn't believe I have a challenge for you and 21:17 as killer if she's willing to withdraw from the TPP her first day in office and 21:25 unconditionally rule out his passage in any form 21:39 there is no way to fix TPP 21:44 we need bilateral trade is we do not need to enter into another massive 21:50 international agreement that ties us up and binds us down like TP does 22:04 a trump Administration will change our failed trade policies and I mean quickly 22:17 thank you here are seven steps 22:20 I would pursue right away to bring back our jobs 22:24 number one I am going to withdraw the United strength from the trans-pacific 22:31 partnership which has not yet been ratified 22:41 I'm going to a point that tough and smartest and I know mall trade 22:47 negotiators to fight on behalf of American workers 22:52 I'm going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of 23:06 trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm you 23:12 the American working 23:17 I will then direct all appropriate agencies to use every tool under 23:25 American and international law to end these abuses and abuse is the right word 23:35 number 4 i'm going to tell our national partners that I intend to immediately 23:45 renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal by a lot not just a 23:53 live by a lot for our words 24:02 and if they don't agree to a renegotiation which they might not 24:06 because they're so used to having their own way 24:11 not with Trump they won't have their own way then i will submit under article 22 24:21 / 24:22 of the NAFTA agreement that America intends to withdraw from the deer number 24:36 5 i'm going to instruct my Treasury secretary to label China a currency 24:43 manipulator which should have been done years ago 24:47 any country that he values their currency in order to take unfair 24:54 advantage of the United States which is many country will be met with Charlotte 25:00 and that includes tariffs and taxes 25:09 number 6 i'm going to instruct the US Trade Representative to bring trade 25:16 cases against China both in this country and act the w 25:22 gia 25:28 China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance 25:34 to the WTO and I intend to enforce those rules and regulations and basically I 25:42 intend to enforce the agreement for all countries including China seven if China 25:52 does not stop 25:54 it's illegal activities including its that of american trade secrets i will 26:01 use every lawful president 26:04 they look this is very easy this is so easy I want to love save this i would 26:10 use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes including the 26:16 application of tariffs consistent with section 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 26:24 1974 and section 232 of the trade expansion act of nineteen sixty-two and 26:33 when they say trade expansion 26:35 they're talking about other countries they're not talking about us because 26:39 there is no expansion 26:40 they get the expansion we get the joblessness that's the way it works 26:45 not going to happen anymore President Reagan deployed similar trade measures 26:55 when motorcycle and semiconductor imports threaten us industry 27:00 I remember his terror or Japanese motorcycles was forty-five percent and 27:07 his terror to shield America's semiconductor industry was one hundred 27:13 percent and that had a big impact folks a big impact 27:19 Hillary Clinton and her campaign fear will try to spread the line that these 27:25 actions will start a trade who already have a trade work and we're losing 27:29 sadly sadly 27:36 she has it completely backwards Hillary Clinton at least a trade war against the 27:41 American worker when she supported one terrible deal after another from NAFTA 27:46 to China to South Korea 27:48 it doesn't matter no matter where she went the American worker was hurt and 27:55 you will be heard worse than ever before 27:58 if she becomes president of the united states that I can 28:09 a jump administration will end that war by getting a fair deal for the American 28:14 people and the American work 28:16 the era of economic surrender will finally be over 28:21 will be over you're not going to see it anymore hello 28:25 I can't guarantee it because estimated that probably start doing it again 28:28 we will have four and maybe eight great great great productive years and will 28:34 never go back and we'll make sure we never go back 28:46 thank you thank you very much thank you very much everyone appreciates a new era 28:56 of prosperity will finally begin 28:59 America will be independent 29:02 once more independent once more doesn't that sound great 29:12 under a trump presidency the American worker will finally have a president who 29:16 will protect them and fight for them 29:23 we will stand up to trade cheating she cheers that's what they are cheaters 29:30 we will stand up to trade chi anywhere and everywhere 29:35 it threatens the American job 29:44 we will make America the best place in the world to start a business will hire 29:49 workers 29:50 it will open factories and we'll get rid of these horrible regulations that make 29:54 it impossible to do business in this country 29:58 this will also include massive tax reform to lift the crushing burden is on 30:08 American workers and businesses 30:10 we will also get rid of all of these rules and all of these problems at all 30:16 of the bureaucracy which are destroyed absolutely destroying our job creation 30:23 capacity which we used to be the best in the world and now we're getting close to 30:28 the bottom folks would get it close to the bottom 30:33 many people think that these regulations are an even greater impediment than the 30:39 fact that we are one of the highest tax nations in the world 30:44 we're also going to fully capture America's tremendous energy capacity 30:50 this will create for our words and that's what we want for our work growth 30:57 for our economy and begin reducing our budget deficits which are massive 31:01 yearly budget deficits massive our trade deficits we don't even want to talk 31:07 about it 31:08 our budget deficits are mess Hillary Clinton wants to shut down energy 31:12 production and shut down the mines and she wants to shut down and she said it 31:17 just recently she wants to shut down the miners 31:22 I want to do exactly the opposite 31:28 yeah 31:35 a trump administration will also ensure that we start using American steel for 31:40 American infrastructure 31:46 and aluminum 31:52 yeah 31:56 just like the American steel from Pennsylvania that built the Empire State 32:01 Building that's we're going to do built the Empire State Building it will be 32:04 American steel that will fortify America's crumbling bridges American 32:10 seal it will be American steel 32:13 it will be American steel that sends our skyscrapers soaring soaring into the sky 32:22 beautiful son more beautiful with Americans deal 32:27 it will be American steel that rebuilds our inner cities 32:31 it will be American hands that we make this country and it will be American 32:37 energy minds from American resources that powers this country 32:51 it will be American workers who are hired to do the job 32:57 nobody else american workers we are going to put American steel and aluminum 33:05 back in to the backbone of our country this alone will create massive numbers 33:17 of jobs high paying jobs good jobs not the jobs we have today which everybody 33:22 agrees are bad jobs 33:24 we're going to create massive numbers of good jobs or drag on immigration on 33:31 foreign policy we are going to put America first again 33:44 we are going to make America wealthy again we are going to reject Hillary 33:57 Clinton's policy of fear and her policy of of absolute nonsense because it's not 34:04 working and it's grossly incompetent and we can't take it any longer 34:09 and we're not going to take it any longer 34:12 we are going to embrace the possibilities of change but real change 34:21 not Obama change real change 34:24 it's time to believe in the future 34:31 it's time to believe in each other 34:34 it's time to believe in America again this is how we are going to make America 34:41 great again for all Americans for all America 34:53 we're going to make America great again for everyone greater than ever before 34:58 and i promise you if I become president we're going to be working again we're 35:03 going to have great jobs again you're going to be so happy you're gonna be 35:07 proud of your president 35:08 you're going to be proud proud proud of our country 35:12 once again thank you very much I appreciate it thank you thank you
