5:31 a lot of money by the DNC and I kept 5:34 saying I wonder why those people here 5:35 because they never seem to have much of 5:38 their mind other than stand up in 5:39 protest and yesterday came out but it 5:42 was barely covered by the media but it's 5:45 all over the internet they were busted 5:48 they were paid fifteen hundred dollars 5:50 each year were given cell phones go up 5:52 and just stir Trump rallies and I sort 5:55 of always do it in chicago even last 5:58 night we had people stand up for no 5:59 reasons like what are they doing here 6:01 and can you imagine that's a big story 6:05 hardly covered by the media so bad 6:12 we're also going to create a new 6:16 government that answers to the people 6:19 Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton the most 6:23 corrupt person ever to run for the 6:26 presidency 6:36 haha 6:44 she should be allowed to run for the 6:47 presidency after what she's done i'll 6:50 tell you stroke 6:52 newly released two days ago FBI 6:57 documents reveal just how deep the 7:01 corruption goes the Undersecretary of 7:04 State patrick kennedy illegally pressure 7:07 the FBI to unclassified emails from 7:11 Hillary Clinton's illegal server sparkly 7:16 and nothing happens to her folks and 7:20 nothing ever happens in other words the 7:24 State Department was trying to cover up 7:26 Hillary's drawn of sending classified 7:29 information on a server our enemies 7:32 could easily access the FBI documents 7:38 show that patrick kennedy made the 7:39 request for altering classification as 7:43 part of a very very serious quid pro quo 7:47 not allowed to do it 7:48 this is a felony corruption yesterday I 7:53 said under secretary Kennedy must 7:56 immediately resign 8:01 the media barely covers this event by 8:05 the one 8:09 this is a bigger event than Watergate 8:12 and they practically refused to cover 8:15 today I'm calling for him to be fired 8:23 clinton and her cronies have sacrificed 8:27 your security your family's safety and 8:31 your country's safety as though it meant 8:33 nothing at all to her 8:37 remember also that Hillary lied under 8:40 oath to Congress saying that she never 8:42 sent to receive classified information 8:45 on her secret sir 8:47 right she never received it on that 8:50 insecure server that she should have 8:53 never been allowed to have that you're 8:54 not allowed to have and pretended not to 8:58 know 8:58 remember this one that the letter cement 9:01 confidential information was classified 9:04 she thought it was the lettering of 9:08 paragraph 9:12 there's ever been a time in our 9:14 country's history or anything like this 9:17 has gone on and the FBI there must be 9:22 people in there based on what you read 9:24 that are ashamed of what happened at the 9:28 Department of Justice there must be 9:30 people in there that are ashamed 9:32 absolutely ashamed of what's been going 9:36 on Hillary then told the FBI's he 9:39 couldn't remember 39 times and then in 9:42 written testimony last week under oath 9:45 she said that she couldn't remember 9:47 another 21 times bad member got a 9:51 terrible memory 9:52 this elaborate criminal cover-up 9:56 included Hillary's deleting and 9:58 bleaching of 33,000 emails the 10:01 disappearance of 13 iphone some by 10:04 hammers two boxes of email evidence gone 10:07 missing 10:08 that was as of last week can you imagine 10:10 they're now missing on top of everything 10:12 else two boxes of emails and the 10:15 destruction of laptops in a secret deal 10:18 with the FBI 10:21 this truly is and I said it 10:25 this truly is many times worse than 10:27 watergate and we're going to put an end 10:30 to it in november a 10:39 we're doing 10:48 another series of leaked emails show top 10:51 officials in the Clinton campaign 10:53 scheming to take massive sums of money 10:56 from registered far and lobbyists then 11:00 you wonder why we do so badly but you 11:05 don't hear the media talking about that 11:06 although you don't see it all as 11:11 WikiLeaks proved the media as merely and 11:15 it truly is 11:16 it's just an extension of the Clinton 11:19 campaign the breasts has created a 11:26 rigged system and poison the mind of so 11:31 many of our voters they have read it 11:36 from the beginning by telling totally 11:38 fall stores most recently about phony 11:41 allegations where I have been under 11:44 constant attack they attack my business 11:48 I built a great business but hello most 11:51 people do it ball they attacked by 11:53 wonderful family they attacked by 11:57 temperament but i built an incredible 12:01 company was papers are filed and I'm 12:05 fortunate to have a beautiful and loving 12:07 family also Milania last night on 12:10 television did a great job 12:16 that's even has to do that is in my 12:19 temperament has always been just about 12:22 my greatest strength we have a winning 12:25 peppermint our country doesn't win 12:28 anymore we don't win anymore 12:32 this is an election about truth and 12:35 you're not going to get it from the 12:37 dishonest video 12:41 some people can't handle the truth no 12:44 matter what people may think of me 12:48 the one thing they know is that we're 12:50 going to tell the American people where 12:52 we stand where we are going to tell them 12:54 the truth now even though we're doing 13:06 pretty good in the polls 13:07 I don't believe the polls anymore I 13:10 don't believe I don't believe them and 13:13 this tentative this one or two bed once 13:15 it's the only way she'll believe me 13:17 folks we're doing great 13:19 if we keep our spirit and if we go out 13:22 and with this is another brexit believe 13:24 me they are so worried 13:26 that's why they become vicious and 13:28 hostile and dirty because they see 13:32 what's going on this rally setup just a 13:35 short while ago look at the number of 13:37 people pack but every rally is the same 13:46 and her rallies very few people show up 13:50 when she has the energy to go to the 13:53 event which is an author she's doing 13:57 debate breath she did so much to bake 14:00 breath did we beat her badly on that 14:03 second football 14:09 sort of funny she's been doing this for 14:11 30 years now she has to do to bake bread 14:13 for five days you know what the debate 14:17 prep is its resting its lying down going 14:21 to sleep i think the media is trying to 14:24 discourage there are people from going 14:26 out to vote and it was just brought up 14:30 to me by a reporter in the back they 14:31 said you know it's very interesting when 14:33 you were fighting 17 people 14:35 the media was nasty but they really get 14:38 nasty when we started to take the lead 14:41 in the polls they said wait a minute 14:42 this thing is gonna happen is gonna 14:44 happen change stop our jobs from leaving 14:48 our companies from leaving strengthen 14:51 our military preserve our Second 14:53 Amendment they're saying this is going 14:55 to happen and it is true made-up stories 14:59 they're liars and made up stories 15:00 without the media and all of the other 15:03 corrupt entities that have helped her 15:05 along the way she would be nothing 15:07 should be nothing she really she would 15:10 be doing so badly even my worst critics 15:14 agree the media's come after us like 15:16 they have never come after anyone before 15:19 my badge of honor I mean you know what 15:22 we're getting even the New York Times 15:27 which is totally dishonest by the way 15:29 here's the good news about the new york 15:31 times they won't be in business much 15:33 longer do you see what they're losing 15:37 they are getting their time and the 15:40 diagnosis because they're very dishonest 15:42 but one of their biggest columnist 15:45 reporters wrote a story about how bad is 15:48 he said let's face it this is in the New 15:51 York Times balance has been on vacation 15:54 since mr. Trump stepped onto this golden 15:57 Trump Tower escalator to announce his 16:00 candidacy can you believe that they're 16:02 admitting it 16:03 they don't even care and actually said 16:05 that we don't care they will do anything 16:07 to stop what we do not me it's what 16:10 we're doing it's an agenda it's going to 16:13 be agenda of change but we won't let 16:17 them stop 16:19 maybe the greatest moment in the history 16:21 of our country 16:38 his is watching us now waiting to see if 16:43 we will rise to the moment we have to 16:47 rise we have to do it 16:49 we're under tremendous opposition with 16:51 the greatest people in the world that's 16:54 what i've learned somebody said what's 16:55 the most important thing you learned how 16:57 great the American people aren't got all 16:59 over the country i have two things I've 17:03 learned that and I've learned how 17:05 totally dishonest the media is it so 17:08 dishonest I've learned that too 17:10 they are the most dishonest people I've 17:13 ever dealt with 17:14 not all of them but honestly like 75% 17:18 some very good but for the most part yes 17:22 we have stories that we think are going 17:25 to be unbelievable stories they turned 17:27 out they make them as bad as possible we 17:30 have stories on the other side that 17:32 would normally dismantle a campaign and 17:35 they don't even report them 17:36 it's a disgrace what's going on is it 17:39 disgrace but we've only just begun to 17:43 fight believe me we have three weeks you 17:46 know what we are three 17:50 and I hear we're doing great in Colorado 17:53 my people back said you're gonna win 17:54 Colorado doesn't matter what 18:03 get out and roam but they even want to 18:07 try and rig the election at the polling 18:10 booths where so many cities are corrupt 18:12 and you see that and voter fraud is all 18:15 too common and then they criticize us 18:17 for saying that and we have even 18:20 Republicans all that such a terrible 18:21 thing to say 18:23 well take a look at Philadelphia what's 18:25 been going on take a look at you gotta 18:26 take a look at sailors take a look at 18:28 some of these cities where you see 18:31 things happening that are horrendous and 18:34 if you talk about them they say bad 18:36 things about you they call your races 18:38 they call you all by the way speaking of 18:41 that nobody will do more for the 18:43 african-american citizens of this 18:45 country than Donald Trump nobody help me 18:49 nobody will do more for the Latino 18:54 community than Donald Trump I can come 18:58 in 2014 the washington post another 19:02 Beauty published an article entitled 19:05 could non-citizens decide the November 19:09 election the article found that fourteen 19:12 percent of non-citizens were registered 19:15 to vote fourteen percent were registered 19:17 to vote 19:19 I would not supposed to talk about it 19:21 and your Republican leadership this 19:23 everything is peachy door and it also 19:27 found non-citizen voting may have given 19:31 Democrats the pivotal 60 votes needed to 19:34 pass Obamacare to Washington mouse not 19:37 me 19:38 the system is also rigged by the donors 19:42 giving hundreds of millions of dollars 19:43 to crooked Hillary Clinton's campaign 19:46 blank spaces the reason Hillary Clinton 19:50 pushes for nafta for the trans-pacific 19:53 partnership which will also be a 19:55 disaster after the worst trade deal ever 19:57 signed ever made by anybody in the world 20:00 where one way highway out we get the 20:04 drugs right we get the drugs we get the 20:08 unemployment we get the empty factories 20:11 mexico in other countries get the cash 20:14 they get the employment they get the 20:16 plants and for completely open borders 20:20 she's once completely open borders is 20:23 because our international donors control 20:26 her every move 20:28 if we left drinkin Hillary's cartel and 20:33 and just remember this run this 20:34 government history will record that 2017 20:39 was the year that America lost truly 20:43 lost its independence truly lost its 20:46 independence and by the way this is our 20:49 final shot folks at four years it's over 20:51 you're never gonna be able to win you're 20:53 never going to be able to win it's 20:54 tilting it's going to be a one-party 20:56 system this is your final shot for the 21:01 Supreme Court for your second Amendment 21:03 I mean this is your final shot november 21:06 eight so hopefully you'll do what you 21:09 know you have to do get out of bed and 21:11 vote no matter how you feel it no matter 21:16 how you feel 21:20 it is indeed time to drain the swamp in 21:23 Washington DC 21:26 this is why I'm proposing a package of 21:29 ethics reforms to make our government 21:33 honest once again 21:35 first I'm going to institute a five-year 21:38 ban on all executive branch officials 21:41 lobbying the government after they leave 21:44 government service right second i'm 21:49 going to ask Congress to institute its 21:52 own five-year bed or lobbying by former 21:55 members of Congress and their staff 21:56 that's a simple one and no this should 22:00 be done but they're not going to do it 22:02 but they'll do it i get in i'm going to 22:05 number three 22:06 expand the definition of lobbyists so 22:09 that we closed all the loopholes that 22:11 former government officials used by 22:14 labeling themselves as consultants and 22:16 advisors when we all know that really 22:19 what they are is lobbyists set make a 22:23 lot of money 22:25 there'll be a lot of respect in that one 22:26 but I'm going to get it through i really 22:28 believe it i'm going to issue a lifetime 22:31 better get senior executive branch 22:34 officials lobby on behalf of a foreign 22:37 government after these evil number five 22:41 are going to ask Congress to pass a 22:44 campaign finance reform that prevents 22:47 registered for lobbyists from raising 22:49 money in American elections would never 22:56 but there's another major announcement 22:58 of going to make today as part of our 22:59 pledge to drain the swamp if I'm elected 23:03 president I will push for a 23:06 constitutional amendment to oppose term 23:09 limits on all members of Congress 23:23 right 23:28 we've been talking about that for years 23:30 decades of failure in Washington and 23:34 decades of special interest dealing must 23:38 and will come to an end and remember by 23:45 the time this ends i will have spent 23:47 over a hundred million dollars in my 23:49 campaign Hillary spend nothing she gets 23:54 older money from the special interests 23:56 and donors and my interest is you higher 24:01 doses or we have to break the cycle of 24:08 corruption we have to give two voices to 24:11 change and we have to we have no do we 24:14 have a choice so that we could have a 24:18 government that works again and can 24:21 function properly which our government 24:23 doesn't right now including giving Iran 24:26 1.7 billion in cash 24:31 and don't remember the deportation of 24:35 800 people turned out to be a hundred 24:37 people then went to 1800 people and 24:41 they're going to be deported for good 24:42 reason 24:43 you know our country to put somebody 24:44 they got to be pretty pretty out there 24:47 well they press the wrong button and we 24:50 congratulations we have 1800 new 24:53 citizens of the United States and what I 24:58 said undo it 24:59 they said that wouldn't be 25:00 constitutional ap folks how stupid are 25:03 we being led the time for congressional 25:08 term limits has finally arrived 25:10 not only will it end our government 25:12 corruption but we will end the economic 25:16 stagnation that we're in right down 25:18 no growth my plan for the economy can be 25:21 summed up in three very beautiful words 25:24 jobs jobs jobs 25:31 at the center of our historic jobs blend 25:36 will be fixing our terrible trade deals 25:38 which I wanted to do from the beginning 25:40 47 million Americans are in poverty and 25:43 45 million Americans are living right 25:45 now on food stamps articulate this is 25:48 our country we have nearly an 800 25:51 billion dollar annual trade deficit in 25:53 goods with the world and the worst 25:55 so-called recovery since the Great 25:57 Depression do you know that the worst 26:00 since the Great Depression Colorado has 26:03 lost 17 manufacturing jobs since bill 26:05 clinton signed after and ideal supported 26:08 by Hillary Clinton very strongly and 26:12 this i thought was a typographical error 26:14 because i figured that meant 704 7,000 26:19 but it wasn't we've lost seventy 26:22 thousand factories since china's entry 26:26 into the World Trade Organization 26:27 another bill and hillary backed disaster 26:32 we are living through the greatest jobs 26:36 that in the history of the world more 26:40 jobs have been stolen from our country 26:42 so stupidly we let him go 26:44 we let our company's go so foolishly we 26:48 don't know what we're doing a trump 26:50 administration is going to renegotiate 26:53 NAFTA stand up to the foreign cheating 26:56 and stop the jobs from leaving our 26:59 country and have jobs come back in the 27:01 upper works 27:02 as part of our plan to bring back to our 27:07 jobs 27:08 we're going to lower up is this tax from 27:10 35% to fifteen percent we're right now 27:15 the highest tax nation in the world 27:17 that's one of the reasons are companies 27:18 are leaving 27:19 we're also going to fix our inner cities 27:22 forty-five percent of african-american 27:25 children under the age of six a living 27:27 in poverty 27:28 fifty-eight percent of african-american 27:32 youth are not working almost 3,500 27:36 people have been shot in the city of 27:38 Chicago can you believe this since 27:40 january first the National murder rate 27:43 has experienced the largest single year 27:45 increase in more than 45 years can you 27:49 believe that murder highest rate and 45 27:52 years so you don't they don't seem to 27:57 your right 27:58 she said nobody cares and you're right 28:00 they don't seem to so to those African 28:04 Americans suffering to those Latino 28:07 suffering i say what do you have to lose 28:11 elect Donald Trump I will fix it we will 28:15 thanks 28:21 we were fixing we're going to get a very 28:24 big african american vote we're going to 28:26 get a very big latino vote because the 28:29 Democrats come in they want you about 28:32 and as soon as you give the vote they 28:34 say seen for years that are doing 28:36 anything it's got worse and worse for 28:39 both the african-americans Latinos 28:41 Hispanics it's got worse and it will 28:45 only get worse they want your vote 28:47 Hillary Clinton said she was going to 28:48 fix upstate New York which you ran for 28:50 the Senate it is a total disaster 28:53 we will be a rich nation once again but 28:56 to be rich country we must also be a 28:59 safe country our national security 29:04 begins at the border speaking and secret 29:10 too far back 29:24 I promise we will build the wall 29:31 Hillary Clinton said her dream is for 29:34 total open trade they go you jobs and 29:37 open borders there goes your country 29:39 symbolism 29:43 there are already a record 65 million 29:47 people in the United States who speak a 29:50 language other than English it's in 29:53 their interest and everyone's interest 29:55 to control immigration so past arrivals 29:57 can integrate into society and really 30:00 join the middle class and the upper 30:02 class but a secret speech to goldman 30:06 sachs she said citizens who want to 30:08 control immigration are an American in 30:11 other words if you want to have a boner 30:14 you want to have a wall which creates a 30:17 country even if you want people to come 30:20 in but coming through a legal process 30:21 she considers that an American so Hilary 30:25 thinks most of the country is either 30:28 deplorable irredeemable on American 30:31 races or basement dwellers in the case 30:34 of the Bernie Sanders people she said 30:36 they were basement dwellers Hillary's 30:38 plan includes an open border with the 30:41 Middle East meeting generations of 30:44 radicalism and terrorism spreading and 30:47 growing within our shores we will be the 30:51 great Trojan horse folks ensures you're 30:53 standing there just today an iraqi 30:56 refugee approved for entry by Hillary 30:59 Clinton State Department pled guilty to 31:02 joining Isis he entered as a refugee in 31:05 November of 2009 and then was approved 31:08 for a green card in 2011 31:10 it's one of hundreds of examples of the 31:13 United States voluntarily admitting 31:15 people from the world's most dangerous 31:17 places who turned out to be terrorists 31:21 so let me state this as clearly as again 31:23 if I'm elected president of the united 31:26 states i am going to keep radical 31:30 Islamic terrorists the hell out of our 31:34 country we have enough problems 31:48 we have enough problems we've got big 31:50 problems 20 trillion in debt we have 31:54 problems like you wouldn't believe will 31:56 also stop the crisis of illegal 31:59 immigration a trump administration will 32:02 secure and defend our borders and we 32:07 will build that wall and Mexico will pay 32:10 for that 32:14 we got the first-ever endorsement from 32:18 our ice and Border Patrol office first 32:21 time they've ever done ice was just last 32:23 with as Secretary of State Hillary 32:26 Clinton
