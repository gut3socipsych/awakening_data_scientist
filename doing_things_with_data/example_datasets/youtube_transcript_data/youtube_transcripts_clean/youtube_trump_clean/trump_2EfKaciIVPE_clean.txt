0:00 I give you the man that we must ensure is the next president of the United 0:05 States of America 0:06 Donald Trump 0:43 yeah 0:44 thank you everybody 0:50 the honor is a great honor 0:53 great state I have a lot of property 0:56 a lot of people in Virginia pay a lot of checks being every night every day 1:02 a lot of great success I've had in Virginia over the years and we have just 1:06 phenomenal stuff in loudoun county as you know and we have down in 1:11 Charlottesville and some other stuff 1:14 tremendous tremendous beautiful property charlottesville is right next to Thomas 1:19 Jefferson who was an architect you know he had great taste 1:25 he had great taste he understood that some of the most beautiful and I've ever 1:28 seen 1:29 so I love Virginia and we are going to win Virginia 1:34 we're gonna win 1:39 i'm going to go over some of the statistics when Tim Kaine was governor 1:45 they're not pretty not pretty but before I do I just want to say that 1:52 debbie Wasserman shows 1:58 yeah 1:59 I always knew she was highly overrated i only hope 2:06 not good but she just got fired and said Debbie 2:13 you're fired get out there be out boom boy 2:19 they were how about that for disloyalty though in terms of Hillary Clinton in 2:24 all fairness because debbie Wasserman Schultz has been so much for Hillary 2:32 Clinton and has brought this by these politicians folks other than Mike Pence 2:37 of course he's great but these politicians hella luck 2:42 so this is a loyalty there right there is no loyalty 2:47 none whatsoever it gets a little heat and they fire get out of here get out of 2:52 here first 2:53 she knew what was going on Hillary Clinton knew what was going on she knew 2:57 everything that was going on she knew it's a rigged system that Bernie Sanders 3:03 never had a chance 3:04 ok he never had a chance and if you look at it 3:08 look what's going on there having a lot of people marching now a lot of those 3:12 people that vote for us i'll tell you right now 3:14 a lot of them 3:18 and not even because they like me or they don't like me although I have to 3:22 see if you see the polls it just came out from right 3:27 we had like the biggest bounce that anyone can remember 3:34 they said well if he gets out of the convention with no bounce that will be a 3:38 success do we have nine points or something 3:41 ten points well leading we're actually leading in the polls 3:51 and the CNN Paul was so good i may have to start liking them again when I don't 3:57 know 3:59 it could now they treated me unfairly but you know what's more important the 4:02 pole but you know the big ball 4:04 the big ball that's no separate that suppose we care about 4:08 but look out this soil crooked Hillary Clinton was to somebody that put her 4:16 life on the line 4:17 I mean she what she did in order to take advantage of Bernie Sanders in all of 4:22 the supporters 4:22 debbie Wasserman should what she did in order to make sure that the system the 4:30 rig system stays intact and hilary gets it and then you see the emails can you 4:35 imagine they talk about religion they talk about religion 4:40 can you imagine if that was my ID right now be on the front page of every 4:46 newspaper would be horrible and they're trying to play it down well that wasn't 4:50 so bad that wasn't open now but could you imagine seriously just such a 4:55 different standard so here's the story is a story 4:57 so Debbie was totally loyal to Hillary and Hillary threw her under a bus and it 5:07 didn't take her more than five minutes to make that decision 5:10 man I don't want her covering my back I'll tell you right now through 5:14 extreme 5:20 now the other thing I'm surprised that you know it's nice when you're not 5:24 reading speeches isn't really because I can talk about current events and stuff 5:28 happened ten minutes ago 5:30 you know if you're reading speeches I see these guys I dealt with a lot of 5:34 them 5:34 I've actually been a very political person in my life I've always been on 5:38 the other side but now for 14 months I've been doing this and I like this 5:42 side in a certain way better because we can do things better 5:44 they used to love me when I was just a contributor I'd get millions of dollars 5:48 just I was a contributing 5:50 now I know we're not I like this battle i like i like being not established with 5:56 better but with Bernie when you look at what happened 6:01 the thing that surprises me most is how we folded he folded 6:06 I thought it was really hanging out tough tough tough 6:09 then they find these horrible emails talking about his religion and dizzy 6:14 Jewish and Izzy an atheist at one and that's not going to play well and sir 6:18 man that's rough and that's not as bad as some of the other ones and I said 6:25 there's no way that Bernie Sanders shows up to make a speech 6:29 there's no way that he can ever indoors crooked Hillary Clinton anymore right 6:35 there's no way and today I see him trying to make the case and his own 6:41 people are out there booing okay they're out there bone so it's pretty bad 6:49 then I'll tell you Hillary Clinton I've been sent this for a long time and I got 6:54 it from Bernie Sanders because he said she suffers from bad judgment right 6:59 bad judgment she suffers from very bad judgment her instincts a bad they're no 7:04 good 7:05 her instincts are defective her instincts are defective 7:10 but she's got she's low energy she actually is long 7:14 should go home she'll take a nap before five hours and she'll come back no naps 7:20 but Trump 7:21 no no I don't take that we don't have time 7:26 we don't have time 7:29 you ever see Hillary where she comes out and she read a teleprompter for a little 7:33 while ninja go home you know 0 for three four days then she comes back and then 7:37 they used to i remember and i would put like three or four people really nice 7:41 people in there sitting around a little table and everyone say well I'd like to 7:45 ask you a question oh you're too tough 7:47 this is what we have how do you think Isis is going to be like yeah I I don't 7:51 think so right 7:52 I don't think so not going to be good now we have tough enemies out there 7:56 we have tough mean vicious horrible horrible people 8:01 he's a horrible horrible human beings we need toughness folks it's about time we 8:07 need strength 8:08 we need toughness we need smarts 8:12 we need warmth we need compassion we need everything we need everything but 8:19 we don't need somebody that goes on to take snaps 8:22 we don't need naps but what did surprise me was that Bernie was so soft on this I 8:29 really i was amazed because i watch the speech you know we must vote for Hillary 8:33 Clinton I mean the hatred he's got but why would he do that 8:37 he looks better if he didn't do it to me hey what do I have to do with it i don't 8:41 care whatever you want to do but could you imagine if what's taking place now 8:45 with the democrats took place in Cleveland and by the way I have to tell 8:49 you Cleveland an amazing job thank you all i owe Thank You Cleveland want a job 8:57 I spoke to the police Jeep 9:01 Calvin did a phenomenal job up there but what we had and the Secret Service 9:06 working with the Secret Service 9:08 what a job they did but Cleveland is a beautiful place i mean really i was so 9:12 happy 9:14 we had no problems that we're trying to show i know they showed this one square 9:17 was this big square and a few people that bring the cameras and plus you know 9:20 really 9:21 because they don't want to show all that beautiful grass of you know with no 9:24 people on and and you know why I'll tell you why because people like our message 9:29 people like our messages they really liked it and if you look at philadelphia 9:36 i went to school in Philadelphia 9:37 I love philadelphia if you look at Philadelphia what they're going through 9:41 right now looks like a lot of people it's a hundred degrees in 9:44 and speaking of that by the way I don't know you so did you know I went to the 9:47 other room so you have a second room and then outside you have over a thousand 9:51 people and it's a hundred and four degrees out 9:54 don't think of it and the first time I ever did it 9:59 I said let's go let's go to the second room first 10:04 right that's the ante room but let's go cuz it's the overflow room I said so I 10:09 went in there we surprised that we were nice but you know i would love these 10:12 people 10:13 but you know what i also like I have to do it later 10:17 and outside we have a lot of people i thought we said let them in the fire 10:21 department won't let him in because of a fire regulation which is very sad 10:25 because they're outside 10:26 it's it's we have speakers out there I think the speakers of burning up folks 10:31 it is hot i wish to fire marshal where's the fire marshal is the rally and come 10:36 on fire month if they could get in fire marshal 10:39 you know you have doors that go right out to the outside I promise is nothing 10:43 like you don't have a problem 10:45 I feel badly we have those people we have people standing outside you can get 10:49 a few more people inside if they could let him in 10:52 so that's the way a builder we'll talk okay 10:56 that's the way I feel good so you had the firing of the head of the DNC and 11:03 that was a vicious firing a lot of things happen you had her firing Hillary 11:09 Clinton's total disloyalty was at play 11:12 it really was people don't say that they won't say that on and the media 11:15 oh if I did something with rights can you imagine if I fired rights 11:20 I wouldn't do that because rights has done such a great job rights previous 11:25 what a job he has done and I always used to say for months now I've been saying 11:34 I'll take rights over Debbie and everyone's at all but deputies are super 11:39 size it so his rights and then it turned out that Debbie flamed out and she's 11:43 gone but the disloyalty was incredible and I really mean that because honestly 11:47 whether you like her or not 11:49 she worked very hard to rig the system so that Hillary got it's true right 11:54 it's sure you know it's true 11:58 she worked very very hard to rig the system 12:02 little did you know that China Russia one of our many many friends came in and 12:11 a half the hell out of us can you imagine 12:14 can you imagine what they're hacking I guarantee we'll find the 33,000 emails 12:30 why did Hillary get rid of her middle name huh 12:34 Hillary no but why did you get rid of it Hillary rotten twin rotten Hillary 12:41 Rodham Clinton right 12:43 maybe that's why is too close no no it's too close 12:47 it's too close you think Mike Pence would say this i don't think so 12:52 by the way did I do a good job with my pants ok 12:56 him and his family 13:00 what a high quality person you know you have to vet people right and we vetted 13:07 Mike and they came back at these are killers 13:10 they came back with many pages on certain people ok many pages I who would 13:15 like to read a book 13:17 many many pages with mike they came back with like nothing he's like the most 13:23 perfect human being 13:24 this guy i said mike did you ever do anything wrong in your whole life 13:28 no I don't think so he is where is he's the best guy that guy's correct I love 13:34 this guy I love them I love but you know what i really like about Mike 13:41 so listen to this to me a very important thing is her bad judgment 13:47 now whether you like Kurt choice 13:51 Tim Kaine nobody even knows who he is now 13:55 he's done a terrible job for Virginia I assumed they said all he picked her you 14:00 know he got picked because of Virginia's Virginia is very important and I'm doing 14:03 very well here 14:04 hey hey I'm employing a lot of people here and they don't employ anybody 14:12 I spent a lot of money in Potomac Falls sterling that area 14:16 I mean I spent a lot of money we have great great things happening next year 14:21 we have two senior pga championship coming thousands and thousands of people 14:25 come into Virginia and spend a lot of money 14:27 thank you i love you to go but but just think of it 14:32 so Hillary Clinton has almost a fifty percent of the people want a progressive 14:39 okay we don't have to like that but that's okay that's where they are they 14:43 want to give everything away and raise your taxes that's what happens 14:46 no no she will have a tax rates by the way have the largest tax cut of anybody 14:50 running for office 14:51 Republican or Democrat ok but Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton will have a tax 14:59 cut that is not there it's going to be a tax cut x 20 in Reverse like a rocket 15:07 ship 15:08 we have the biggest tax cut proposal I guess it'll last for years and we're 15:15 gonna get it through at least we're gonna get most of it through i'll tell 15:17 you what I'm trying to get all of it through but we have and its policy it's 15:21 you know put out there that doesn't mean there's not a little negotiation because 15:25 we're going to have to negotiate but we're going to have it go 15:28 Hillary Clinton is gonna have one of the biggest taxes creases in the history of 15:32 our country because what she's proposing 15:35 you're gonna have to pay for a very simple very simple 15:38 now maybe she'll you know after she gets her to burn to get rid of all the stuff 15:42 that doesn't help you by the way but what she's proposing 15:46 she needs to have a massive massive tax increase 15:51 now nobody ever talks about that do you notice he never talks about who's going 15:54 to pay for it now they're going to pay but just statistically she's going to 15:58 need a very major tax cut but here's something to me that's very interesting 16:02 fifty percent of that party is Bernie Sanders almost and they're very 16:07 passionate and that's a much more 16:08 passionate side her people they fall asleep okay they fall asleep there 16:12 watching on with Bernie's people they're really out there 16:16 they say what you want about Bernie Sanders he got it on free trade 16:20 he got it free trade now i'm gonna i'm totally on the free trade i believe in 16:25 free trade you know they get it all wrong because they just don't say it 16:28 properly but I want smart red 16:31 I want I want to trade with other countries but I don't want to lose 500 16:34 billion dollars here with China Thank You china we love you very much but 16:38 we're not going to lose 500 billion dollars and I don't want to have a trade 16:42 in balance with Japan where they send as millions of cars and we sent them some 16:46 beef and then they send it back right and then they we send some wheat we 16:52 they said cars we said we'd sounds like we got to sit in a lot of we write the 16:56 trade balances message and with Mexico we have an unbelievably big train amount 17:03 so they kill us at the border they kill us they're killing us at the border and 17:08 we have one of the biggest trade imbalances and what happens what happens 17:12 I'm not even including the drugs right the drugs are pouring across you know I 17:16 won the state of New Hampshire and I got very very friendly with the people in 17:19 New Hampshire i'll never forget them because that's an amazing group of 17:23 people and I said what's your biggest problem is that heroin pouring across 17:27 the southern border 17:28 I said heroin New Hampshire because you look at new hampshire so beautiful with 17:33 the lakes and the little beautiful roads and the trees and the forest I say you 17:37 don't heron 17:38 I think you have he said mr. Trump you have no idea is one of the worst areas 17:43 for that it comes pouring across the southern what I said you know what if I 17:47 win I'm going to sit I'm gonna fix that problem 17:51 where 17:52 i am going to fix that problem I'm gonna fix that problem and one of the ways I 18:01 appreciate that 18:02 you know I always like to say if I would because honestly 18:05 life is a very strange thing and things and I don't want to be arrogant because 18:09 i don't want to be accused by them of being arrogant so i'll say if but it 18:14 better be when i'm going to be very angry you folks from Virginia from 18:19 Virginia but the folks in New Hampshire and you're having the same problems but 18:25 they have a good for whatever reason disproportionately badly 18:29 heroin is pouring across the border and it's going a lot of it's going all over 18:33 the country by the way everybody's got the problem you buy it for less than a 18:36 candy bar and our youth is being poisoned and plenty of other people but 18:41 our youth is being poisoned by this stuff heroin heroin and what we're going 18:47 to do thank you 18:49 and what we're going to do is first of all the border patrol agents endorsement 18:54 16,500 they've never done back and their job is easier now without Trump their 19:02 job is easier without Trump because you know right now they just and people go 19:06 by and these are great people 19:08 I got to know him very well the border patrol agents want to do their job it's 19:13 a much tougher job probably a much more dangerous you up when you sell people 19:16 and say sorry folks bomb go back but that's what dangerous and saying you 19:21 know we can't do anything 19:23 it's called stand back stand back and leave me alone let him walk right in 19:27 how stupid we have stupid over ok so I spoke to them when they endorse me and I 19:34 said so let me ask you a wall 19:36 how important they said mr. Trump it's very very important very 19:41 and they know 19:44 they now see I just saved a million dollars 19:47 somebody else would go out and hire a consultant who knows nothing 19:51 they come in from Harvard they spent about a year at the border they learned 19:56 nothing 19:57 they then write this 2,000 page report that nobody worried they'll charge you 1 20:01 million dollars for the report and you have no idea what just happened 20:05 as opposed to saying like i did with the Border Patrol is a wall good they said 20:11 very good 20:11 they actually is an interesting expression they said it's a vital tool 20:15 to turn things around it was a very interesting expression that it's a great 20:20 man they just said it's a vital tool mr. Trump to turn things around 20:25 especially the drug traffic because it's very tough and we can build that wall so 20:30 easily 20:31 and by the way Mexico is going to pay for the wall you know just just because 20:36 they're going to pay for the way and I got great 20:41 we got great marks on the on the speech the other night and everyone did 20:44 everybody did so great 20:46 we had such that by the way after seven the Republican National Convention was 20:53 such a tremendous success 20:55 it was so great I mean we had a couple of people that I think probably 21:00 destroyed their careers but who knows but 21:03 but honestly though but honestly that was such an incredible success and look 21:11 at what's going on in front of you 21:13 that was such a beautiful deal the city of Cleveland was great 21:17 the law enforcement was unbelievable we had no riots we had no nothing it was 21:22 unbelievable 21:23 I'll never forget it as long as I live it was on being believable and and I 21:32 made his speech and i have to tell you because I figured this would not because 21:36 I could have I made a speech if I if I gave the gettysburg address is given as 21:41 good as anybody could possibly get 21:43 I figured you know you always get nakey always get not 21:47 I got great reviews on this Beach I got great reviews 21:50 we got standing ovations some people said well the speech was a little long 21:53 that's because we had 26 or 27 minutes of Lake standing ovations 21:57 we had applause and I had a great time doing it because i'm talking about 22:01 something that I love we're in a movement folks this is a movement this 22:05 is it just 22:05 I love what we're doing together right i love i love what we're doing 22:10 I love it and what really what I have to say is this 22:17 so Hillary Clinton is bad judgment she shouldn't have picked this guy 22:23 Kristen 22:24 because he is the exact opposite what all of the Bernie people want 22:29 now if he got two percent of the vote or five percent of the vote or twenty 22:33 percent of the vote 22:34 she's but you know what he almost beat her 22:37 if the system was it gamed if the system was in game he would have been her we 22:43 would have beaten her now 22:44 now think of this so instead of picking somebody and you don't have to go with 22:49 Pocahontas you don't have to go that far 22:51 who by the way who hasn't done anything she's the worst 22:54 she is the worst senator of the usn you know she's got a fresh mouth other bet 22:59 she's got nothing going 23:00 she has got she has done nothing at the US Senate but you don't have to pick her 23:04 but you could've picked a liberal person and we understand it what we can live 23:08 with it and you know she could have had a party unity instead they have 23:12 thousands and thousands of people going crazy because she didn't pick somebody 23:16 representative 23:18 she didn't pick somebody representative what's going on 23:21 let's let's go look again she's got bad judgment whether it's Libya whether it's 23:28 a Benghazi whether it's at night with the calls with the cause everybody's 23:33 going the only cause she answers is her friend calls 23:37 she picked that one up but she doesn't pick up the calls to help 23:41 she's got bad judgment Bernie Sanders said she's got bad judgment 23:48 she's got bad judgment when it came to picking a vice presidential candidate 23:54 for that side of the party 23:58 yeah 24:02 I actually just ask Mike Pence 24:05 I said my do you think she's going to be forced to change because honestly 24:08 now I wouldn't pick him i wouldn't pick him for a different reason you know why 24:13 I would pick him 24:14 so Mike Pence in Indiana has done an unbelievable job 24:19 a triple a bond rating so many different things job creation top and virtually 24:25 every category right toward the top at the top 24:28 listen to this during tim kaine's tenure as governor of Virginia plus he's not 24:35 very popular 24:36 I thought that I would see Paul saying is at eighty-five percent and Trump is 24:41 going to lose Virginia I'm gonna eat people don't even like the guy and you 24:47 learn and we'd weird little dude there 24:50 I don't know what's going on with him during tim kaine's tenure as governor of 24:55 Virginia from 2006 - 2010 24:59 the unemployment rate of the state more than doubled so I immediately went back 25:07 to my statistician I said listen do me a favor will you please check it came back 25:12 he said hey maybe he's wrong but more than doubled this is your great governor 25:16 right now Governor Mike Pence cut unemployment rate from 8.4 percent to 25:21 less than five percent quickly 25:26 yeah 25:28 since 2000 turn 13 Indiana's God from thirty first in the nation for veterans 25:35 unemployment to second and it's going to go to first 25:38 ok veterans are blown during tim kaine that's the guy that bad judgment crooked 25:51 Hillary Clinton bad judgment 25:54 such badger we can't have another president with bad judge but we can't do 25:59 it during tim kaine's tenure as governor the state of Virginia lost sixty 26:09 thousand manufacturing jobs now Indiana gained thirty thousand now it's a 26:14 different time and different everything he was you know is I'm not comparing 26:16 they're not cause they'll say well one was here was that but i'll tell you if 26:21 mike pence for me was running virginia with the great 26:25 this guy did a lousy job you know why is the political hack 26:29 that's why he's a political act look what he's done look what he's done he's 26:34 always been in politics 26:36 he likes politics he wants to be in politics always 26:39 ok during tim kaine centers governor virginia it averaged almost no gdp 26:46 growth and Indiana as you know is doing great i mean think of it 26:51 here's a beauty ok nobody is going to vote for Tim Kaine when you hear this 26:58 one ok 26:59 tim kaine and if I never heard of this guy but that's okay 27:02 less than a week after Tim Kaine became governor of Virginia one week he 27:09 proposed a nearly four billion dollar tax increase 27:14 four billion 27:19 including a tax increase on people earning as little as seventeen thousand 27:25 dollars here 27:28 he tried to pass a transportation reform he failed 27:35 where's mike pence a tremendous like I mean the whole thing is ridiculous 27:38 so a four billion dollar tax increases first week 27:41 do we want this is the president now you know like hopefully we're not too 27:45 worried about it i will say this 27:49 Virginia has lost one and three manufacturing jobs since built let these 27:53 are my status stations are great 27:55 signed the agreement to put china into the World Trade Organization don't 27:59 forget he did that but bill clinton signed something that was the worst 28:03 trade bill ever the history of this country 28:05 ok in the history of this country after that was built that people don't realize 28:11 i'll tell you a little joke see how hot it is everyone everyone sweating and 28:15 soaking wet right here's the difference 28:18 i would pay the hotel bill I'd say we're in a hotel 28:22 we're in a ballroom and you know what that these are growing companies 28:28 we're in a ballroom and we're in a ballroom it's not supposed to be so hot 28:32 that everybody in the audience is using as a fan 28:34 so what they do is they turn the air conditioning down because they save 28:37 money 28:38 so then i would not pay them and you know what i do i pay my bills so fast 28:43 with somebody good with somebody average ape am ok with somebody great a lot of 28:47 times they give bonuses but here we are in a ballroom and I'm like I feel like 28:53 him i'm in a sauna 28:55 ok 28:56 right 29:00 right 29:02 so I don't know what hotel this is what you want to try turning on the air 29:07 conditioning we're not going to get your pay these people is it am i right 29:14 hot but just so you know I'm really good at this business 29:20 you make a lot more money if you want a hotel and you let people suffer and 29:25 don't turn on the air conditioning 29:27 you make a lot more money you would be surprised at how much it cause but this 29:31 is ridiculous and so then they'll be an article 29:33 Donald Trump refuses to pay the bill good and you know what the smart people 29:41 say Trump is smart 29:42 the other people would say always in that terrible okay i think the ballroom 29:46 and the people that on this hotel should be ashamed of himself that 29:50 so look block 29:54 so Virginia lost one and three manufacturing jobs since the bill 30:01 clinton bill Hillary supported Chinese entry into the WTO roanoke which is a 30:07 beautiful place by the way has lost one and I've been here many times as long as 30:10 one in three manufacturing jobs ok since the Clinton disasters 30:17 last year the US trade deficit with TPP countries i mean i could go into this i 30:22 could read this stuff he gets a little boring after all but it's all the same 30:25 thing 30:26 we have Hillary Clinton wanted to approve TP that's trans-pacific 30:30 partnership and then I announce that I'm against it and then she heard me making 30:35 his face 30:36 this is what i've heard a friend of mine told me and I basically said the various 30:40 reasons including monetary manipulation currency manipulation etc 30:44 why it's so good why it will be another nasty but maybe even worse 30:48 can't be worse but it'll be his bed ok different countries but it will be has 30:51 been and she heard me and she said oh he'll kill me under debate 30:55 so what happened is she all of a sudden came out against TPP 30:59 but as sure as you're sitting there she's going to approve TPS you one 31:03 she will approve it will make a change she'll make a comment you say move that 31:07 come on now i can do it okay folks 6,000 pages of material that most people 31:14 haven't read it is a disaster trans-pacific partnership is a disaster 31:19 you can't let it happen we will never let it happen I will never ever let him 31:25 and I don't want to make deals with many countries i want to do one-on-one deals 31:31 one on one 31:32 you got to see this deal it's like a fancy jigsaw puzzle lines going here 31:37 here they're so one of the country misty haze you can't do anything it's just 31:41 locked up into this very complex again 31:43 I believe me it's just like Obamacare thousands of pages and nobody in 31:48 Congress read it and now it's a disaster and we will repeal it and replace it 31:52 with something fabulous okay all right 31:59 but but we're going to have something that's going to be very special and i 32:06 have to tell you I appreciate your being here and I really wish I appreciate it 32:11 thank you thank you thank you thank you and I appreciate the folks in the room 32:18 next door which is almost as big as this and it's packed also and even more than 32:23 you folks I appreciate the people standing outside a hundred for their 32:26 dying there dying 32:29 although I venture to say that they're more comfortable that I am right now 32:34 it's probably I think it's actually cooler outside that it is in this damn 32:38 ballroom ridiculous 32:41 yeah 32:42 yeah 32:44 predict 32:50 but you know what I I'll tell you know what I love looking at the rover's back 32:53 you know what I love and the other rows back what I love nobody left not one 32:57 person i was watching doors i seed or solid open people pouring out 33:01 I usually stop but that never happens with me never ever 33:05 but what I stop nobody lives because you know what we're in this together 33:10 we're in this together this is a movement so Time magazine just another 33:15 cover I talk about it you saw the one from the back of my head right it's 33:19 pretty full back to you know 33:21 could be could be better could be better but not been but a picture from the back 33:26 of my head the guy was standing right off of me with a camera like this 33:30 I studied that picture very close i didn't read the story but i did study 33:33 the picture 33:35 no I think that's number five or six that we've had so i think i've had two 33:40 in my lifetime and five or six in the last few months where you know we had 33:45 this incredible thing going on and they call it a movement and Bill O'Reilly 33:49 calls in a movie he's never seen anything like he said in his 33:52 professional career in his own lifetime 33:55 he actually said this is the single greatest political phenomenon that has 33:59 ever witness and britt you himself and a lot of people 34:05 and I really mean is it's not about me it's about you 34:09 there's there I'm a messenger there's a group of people in this country that's 34:14 massive 34:15 you know they used to call it a silent majority I don't use the term 34:18 it's a noisy majority because we've had it we've had it with the Iran deal 34:22 we've had it with are depleted military 34:26 we've had it with no borders we've had it with education where were ranked 34:33 right near the bottom we're doing horribly 34:36 we've had it where they want to essentially abolish your second 34:40 Amendment you have no protection for yourself 34:42 we have 34:44 and by the way the NRA endorsed me and they're great people 34:49 one hundred percent and the evangelicals how many evangelicals do we have in here 35:00 you better get out and vote because you didn't vote for Romney and you better 35:05 get out and vote for me you know we have the Johnson amendment where Lyndon 35:09 Johnson who is very powerful 35:12 put in a member we basically are pastors are ministers and all religions they 35:17 don't have the right to speak up that I had I had a meeting i was telling 35:22 Franklin Graham was a great guy I was telling Jerry Falwell Jr is a great guy 35:26 great guy 35:29 I mean so many we had a meeting what we had 50 to 60 pastors ministers and they 35:36 were saying we love you and they were praying and it was like this incredible 35:39 scene and I said okay well folks can you endorse me what we can't do that why 35:44 because we'll lose our tax exempt stance 35:47 I said why now nobody brought this up to me they were living with it 35:51 nobody was going to go find it I said why do you lose your tax exempt status 35:55 what we're not allowed to speak and I said wait 35:58 and I looked into it I said whoa and that was passed by the ultimate 36:01 politician Lyndon Johnson I mean it's not like we're dealing with the Pope 36:04 this was Lyndon Johnson smart tough guy but we're smarter and tougher but look 36:10 that was passed by a politician because he had problems with some of the 36:16 churches in Texas where they were going after him for good reason 36:20 and I said wait a minute folks and we put in our platform that we're going to 36:24 work like hell to get rid of the Johnson Amendment because 36:31 because your representatives ministers and pastors rabbis they have totally 36:42 lost their voice and don't kid yourself 36:46 that's what's happening to religion in this country because you see the same 36:50 numbers that i see so I think this if you're evangelical of your Christian of 36:54 your Jewish if you have religion 36:56 you better go out and vote for Trump because this is going to be the last 36:59 chance you ever get to get this thinking okay 37:07 so 37:14 thank you thank you 37:16 thank you 37:20 and i said in my I will say this 37:24 I will say this i said in my speech the other night and I meant it 37:29 I thank the evangelicals because i want i got these tremendous votes they say 37:34 Trump care twin south carolina right 37:37 I said why because i have this tremendous crab 37:40 I one with evangelicals I want all over with evangelicals because they get it 37:45 they're smart they understand they know i'm not perfect i'm not perfect but they 37:51 know i love them and they know i'm going to fight for him better than somebody 37:54 that is perfect 37:55 ok I'm going to fight for and I'm going to fight for other religions 38:00 I'm going to fight i'm going to fight for people to be able to speak and 38:05 actually when they said this to me i was in an office building very high up and 38:08 I'm looking down and I said to these powerful pastors and these powerful men 38:13 and women 38:14 it's just powerful people with tremendous strength and energy and 38:20 conviction and they're so when they're in the Roman it was beautiful the voices 38:24 and I said but that means that you are less powerful than those people walking 38:30 down the street I pointed to the street because they have a right to talk and 38:34 you don't you don't have your right to talk 38:36 ok and that's our religion that's our religion in my case I'm presbyterian I'm 38:43 Protestant but but that's our religion and my minister who are like a lot 38:48 doesn't have the right to speak 38:50 we're going to end that folks you have one chance would have it 38:54 so you better go back to your churches and you better get everybody to vote 38:58 because for years ago they didn't get up and they didn't vote for Romney and to 39:04 this day a lot of people don't understand some people to understand 39:07 frankly but you better get up and you better vote because if you vote if you 39:11 think about it the if you take christian jewish take some of the Catholic take 39:17 the religions 39:19 it's bigger than men and it's bigger than women right speaker than men 39:22 you know man of fifty percent women of fifty percent the religious like what 39:27 eighty percent right 39:28 if you get up and vote we're going to get rid of that and we're going to free 39:33 up great people to go and speak what they want to speak about and they should 39:37 be able to speak 39:39 ok very important 39:46 so just a couple of things and I i I'd like to bring my cup 39:49 I just a couple of things we are going to strengthen our military military is 39:53 really depleted is not good 39:55 I didn't want to go into Iraq we got there I said keep the oil they didn't 40:01 keep the oil these people don't know what they're doing 40:04 you know the old days you're in a war to the victor belongs the spoils 40:07 right today we get nothing trillions of dollars and caused thousands and 40:12 thousands of lives lost 40:14 we got nothing Iraq is a disaster the Middle East is worse now than it was 15 40:18 years ago by a factor of 20 40:20 ok we would have done nothing we would have been much better off we gotta build 40:23 up our military 40:25 we never needed it so much we never needed our military so much 40:29 so we're going to take care of our country we're going to take care of our 40:32 vets we're going to take care of our people 40:34 we're going to make America great again i don't and i have to tell you one of 40:38 the really good decisions because I laugh when they say do you think mr. 40:42 Trump likes Governor Mike Pence i love this guy 40:45 he's great he's great and everybody does 40:48 I'm getting such great marks and such great reviews unlike Hilary did i ask 40:53 you before you think she'll change 40:55 he looked to be sitting away because it's hard to do right she may be forced 40:59 she may be forced to change he actually i'll tell you 41:03 Tim Cain stands for the exact opposite of all of the Bernie Sanders people 41:08 I mean it's ridiculous what she did again bad judgment 41:12 so I'm gonna have Mike say just a few of the final words and I'm going to sit 41:16 down and watch him he is some great person 41:20 he's got some wonderful family and we are having such fun going all over the 41:25 place and so my can
