the leader of the free and on free world has vanished 10:24 I've decided to do something about it I couldn't stand to see what was happening 10:28 to our great country this mess calls for leadership in the worst way it needs 10:34 someone with common sense and business acumen someone who can truly lead 10:38 America back to what has made us great in the past we need someone with a 10:42 proven track record in business who understands greatness someone who can 10:47 rally us to the standard of excellence we wants epitomize i started with the 10:52 issue of illegal immigration and proposed building a major wall that 10:57 would be very high and completely impervious to the flood of immigrants 11:01 who we don't want or need here illegally suddenly American started to wake up to 11:07 what was going on with regard to illegal immigration 11:10 despite the large number of candidates who are running for the Republican 11:13 nomination what i was saying started to really hit home with people started 11:19 very large crowd so that we had to move our rallies in the football stadium 11:25 the first national debate 224 million viewers which set a record for cable 11:29 television 11:31 all of a sudden people who have never cared about the election or never voted 11:35 before we're rushing to our 11:38 the rallies became massive 11:41 unbelievable 11:42 enthusiasm was based on pure love and love 11:46 we were doing 11:47 the media the politicians and the so-called leaders of our country reacted 11:52 in horrible but I persevered and went directly to the people because I don't 11:58 need anyone's financial support nor do i need anyone's approval as to what to say 12:03 I just had to do the right thing I had to do it 12:08 I had no choice i see what's happening to our country is going to hell I had to 12:14 do it who I've committed to a truly more powerful military one prepared and 12:22 equipped to stand up to any and all of her phone 12:25 when we draw 12:26 line in the sand it needs to mean something to all 12:30 especially our enemies 12:34 released a tax plan that gives the middle class 12:37 well rain comes 12:38 is to keep more of what they earn while restructuring how the richest America 12:48 I've introduced a home 12:50 the job creation by encouraging companies to bring more their jobs and 12:54 manufacturing back to the unit 12:58 along with the trillions of dollars 13:02 thanks overseas but we need his leadership that can deal with our mess 13:06 and begin to apply practice 13:11 so much 13:13 wait this is not 13:14 together 13:17 good great again I know people talk to you about whether or not you want to run 13:23 which it would you ever I just probably wouldn't do it but i probably wouldn't 13:27 that I do to try to see what's happening with this country and forget so bad I 13:31 would never want to without totally US National that currently stands at 13:35 eighteen point three trillion daughters in the flood of Fighters joining Isis is 13:39 much 13:45 yeah 13:56 yeah 13:58 haha 14:02 yeah 14:08 yeah 14:14 yeah 14:19 yeah 14:28 yeah 14:30 celebrates . for everyone 14:33 yeah 14:36 little bit different for you losing your job is to brought the light 14:41 manufacturing is leaving the shop there will bring us off like nobody has ever 14:55 read over the country 14:57 don't worry about megan fox I'm looking at these numbers you know before I leave 15:02 honestly they're all pretty similar to break one night I think making your 15:06 little bit worse bring the border region of getting and i would say give me the 15:13 stats on Prince water we're right and you don't answer that tremendous victory 15:23 they're running on boy possible 450 don't forget fifty percent when you have 15:31 three people running the talk about these characters in the be the world's 15:34 most people they don't know what's out there lying i want all these things and 15:43 you have these pundits not for people 15:48 and the second I'd like 70 people code so the beginning would have 16 14 12 and 15:55 win and there's a Donald Trump did not get fifty percent how to get the percent 16:00 we have all these people right now we have three 16:04 I call it too but I really going to have because i think that why 16:14 yeah 16:19 he's got no parents / statistically get one anymore 16:26 you know what's nice when a place like New York those be better than your home 16:32 right 16:32 it's like you by lifting risk or somebody did a nasty story the people 16:37 that don't master the New York people they wanted record 62-percent almost 16:47 it all started well you have to get fifty percent thought you couldn't get 16:52 because you're three people run but was funny i have one where they 40 people 16:58 and I did everyone what assets and I want and then I hear you didn't get over 17:04 it and I have senators and governors and people like been tossing his phenomenal 17:09 by the way 17:14 really 17:16 kind of movies park people and yeah 15 16 17 and then you win and they say you 17:22 should get thirty percent and you don't like the sound to it 17:27 I mean who conducted so now you're didn't think was fifty percent we got 17:32 almost 62-percent 95 delegates we were almost every delegate so I mean it was 17:43 great 17:44 so what's happening is that not that proves yes no pathway to victory 17:48 other than being short seller is no pathway different and case you know he's 17:55 138th running right 17:58 why you running running 18:03 a lot of people a lot of people better than Jason and they said well it's not

bridgeport employed because you 48:11 bet you're coming back and what happens is an ideal want to see these companies 48:16 before the nobody talks everybody talks so when confidence i don't think

and I told you 50:20 single-wall is so tough on drugs i mean this country 50:30 I don't want to have to tell what do they don't sing he said the hand yeah 50:35 drunk people wandering once it was so top problem another problem 50:46 no games with us 50:50 one slice like eight times and then they start getting tougher can't sell it but 50:56 i told the people told South Carolina South Carolina that was supposed to be a 51:01 stronghold only one reason why i went with jennifer and I wanted to I want to 51:15 Louisiana and that's what I'm realizing system's rigged because that one Lewis 51:18 yet and I said I wasn't supposed to win this hand I was behind I was not 51:24 supposed to win that was supposed to be temporary and remember what are also 51:27 other people there are other people doing some weight and now i'm getting 51:31 over fifty percent with all these people that went down to 35 remember when they 51:36 see fifty percent i was having 12 and 14 purchased car world 51:42 yes 51:45 resort like stuff and he was there was was trying to explain how the fact that 51:56 i want your one of the greatest landslides and floods ever seen already 52:00 that was it was and even our single person but even he was like real and i 52:10 hate the level of hatred by the establishment of us is so incredible 52:15 it's so totally because Trump watch these jobs and they were talking about 52:29 the 50 and he said again to present this side and 61 or 62 percent it came up 52:37 with another there but when you watch him struggle 52:40 he's all nervous and all crazy because this is one of the biggest 52:45 even people that hate that was a massive infection right and he's working so hard 52:51 know that much 52:53 totally ignore that and you see the system so what happens is Louisiana was 53:02 to Ted Cruz was going to win this is gonna be all there's only one problem 53:15 I said before and I don't want to get out of your fingers on the trigger 53:25 I want how I want it so we want place . Kentucky we won so many devices Florida 53:32 one of the great we're going right unless it's just something that's pretty 53:38 different 53:39 ok what we have and I said that people system i really found out about the rich 53:45 system because i was behind I wasn't supposed to 53:50 I was doable and then came out there were several reports 53:54 let's give it a shot so I went out there a couple times and the final lines of 53:59 friday night and I made a speech and we had an airplane hangar was massive line 54:04 for Boeing 747 it was a mess and we set out comment to make a speech tonight 54:09 before the election that election to place and belief or sad and I made a 54:13 speech and the people were unbelievable things like a love like this is it was 54:18 like a love 54:24 that's how the loop into the type of time like we never had in the history of 54:33 our country making this speech and the next day and you let you want i want i 54:47 was supposed to be upset and is now a couple weeks later the reading of 54:52 different things showing our workers were winning and most bus and then I see 54:59 always has all your mistake as one thing I want to stay easily and you have this 55:08 guy is having more intelligence i want i want to lose you and you have to be here 55:19 with one that can't be possible 55:20 how'd you get it and you don't get it it's a rate 55:26 so you can't win with a bit you will get desperate when they start doing negative 55:34 is I 55,000 negative events cases had one when they suck want to Jason 55:41 whatever it's going to be . but you know what happens as it happens then all of a 55:48 sudden have only been cold stuff on all the Sun rises on radio because how do 55:54 you want to stay so we started focusing and watch out the delegates
