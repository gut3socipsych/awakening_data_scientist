horrible healthcare does it work 7:15 the deductible is so high you'll never 7:17 get to use it it's so high so it's a 7:20 horrible thing we're going to repeal it 7:21 we're gonna replace it 7:22 we have so many unbelievable alternative 7:25 much less expensive much less expensive 7:29 and great healthcare much lower 7:33 deductibles great healthcare and much 7:35 less expensive it's horrible how we got 7:38 into this mess 7:39 do you believe it we have wars we never 7:43 win we have borders that don't exist 7:46 everything we do it just doesn't work 7:48 you know the fact is I say it all the 7:50 time our country doesn't win anymore 7:53 we're going to start winning again with 7:54 everybody will start winning new mexico 8:01 will be one of the state's hurt most by 8:05 Obamacare you see that with the number I 8:07 just gave you unfortunately and New 8:10 Mexico families won't have enough money 8:12 left over to pay their bills or to get 8:15 medicine for their children 8:31 you are amazing people I'll tell you 8:34 great people great people 8:39 you're great people a lot of people in 8:42 this country they've been hurt 8:44 they've been hurt by incompetent 8:45 politicians by politicians it just take 8:49 care of themselves for special interest 8:51 you great people so elect me and we will 8:54 stop the premium hikes in New Mexico and 8:58 all over the country we will stop the 9:01 Obamacare madness it's madness madness 9:05 in Minnesota where the premium increase 9:10 will be close to sixty percent not 9:12 nearly as hires new mexico the 9:15 Democratic governor said the Affordable 9:18 Care Act is no longer affordable and i 9:21 use his quote because it's so correct 9:24 Hillary Clinton wants to double down and 9:27 Obamacare make it even more expensive in 9:30 fact much more expense 9:35 and.and folks it's not gonna work okay 9:39 and I said it before they passed it and 9:42 it was passed with lies you remember 9:44 Obama 28 times you can keep your plan 9:47 you can keep your doctor guess what you 9:49 can't keep either and he also didn't 9:53 talk about these kind of increases and 9:55 next year's gonna be worse 9:57 next year's gonna be worse so she wants 9:59 to double down I think she's got bigger 10:01 problems right now if you want to really 10:02 know that 10:21 what a time we're living in I'm asking 10:26 for your vote so we can replace 10:27 Obamacare and save healthcare for every 10:30 family in New Mexico and in the United 10:34 States real change also means restoring 10:42 honesty to our government we all know 10:45 about Hillary's mounting legal troubles 10:48 that she has brought onto herself with 10:51 her cereal willful purposeful and 10:55 deliberate criminal conduct Hillary 10:58 Clinton is not the victim you the 11:01 American people of the victims of this 11:03 corrupt system in every single way and 11:10 folks this is your last chance to save 11:13 it i really believe that all that sounds 11:16 good this Bob 11:21 I love the sound but that's an old one 11:25 that makes a lot of noise that's okay I 11:27 still love the set this is your last 11:31 chance you're not going to do it in four 11:34 years from now it's not gonna happen 11:35 it's not gonna happen you know that you 11:38 know what's going on now the FBI has 11:41 found you're not going to believe this 11:43 one this just happened 11:44 this is the single biggest scandal since 11:49 Watergate my contract with the American 11:53 voter begins with a plan to end the 11:56 rampant government corruption 11:59 I want the entire corrupt Washington 12:03 establishment to hear and he the words 12:07 that we not me we are all about the same 12:10 ready when we win on november eight get 12:16 out and vote get out involved 12:17 we're going to Washington DC and we are 12:22 going to drain the swamp knob 12:31 you know i i've made a couple of these 12:36 massive speeches today the crowds are 12:38 always so big and I said you know drain 12:40 the swamp I didn't like it started two 12:42 weeks ago right 12:43 and I said it sounded so hokey I don't 12:46 want to do it and they said no it's 12:49 something that's cute it's nice let's 12:50 say who knows and I gave it to one group 12:52 they went crazy then I gave it to 12:55 another group that went crazier and then 12:57 people at the third speech they started 13:00 screaming the words to me i didn't even 13:02 Sam mr. Trump drain the swamp and then 13:07 what happened well and then what 13:11 happened 13:13 God 13:24 amazing you never know you never know in 13:27 life you never know what works but that 13:29 one works because people are going crazy 13:31 over drain the swamp and you know then I 13:34 went and all of a sudden everybody's 13:36 going crazy over because it's so 13:38 descriptive but you never know in life 13:40 what works 13:41 Frank Sinatra did my way he hated the 13:44 song he didn't like it he said I'll 13:46 never work that he sang it and people 13:47 loved it 13:48 sang it again then went out became the 13:50 number one song then all of a sudden 13:52 loved it right that's the way it works 13:54 but at the color of my contract is my 13:57 plan to bring back our jobs and that 14:00 means the great jobs really really good 14:04 jobs we've lost so many of them but 14:06 great jobs for New Mexico right now 70 14:10 million American women and children live 14:12 in poverty or on the brink of poverty 14:15 right on the brink forty-three percent 14:17 of african-american school-aged children 14:20 live in poverty 14:23 thirty-four percent of hispanic 14:26 school-aged children live in poverty 14:29 this is unacceptable in the United 14:32 States this is unacceptable as your 14:37 president I will go into the poorest 14:40 communities and work on a national plan 14:43 for revitalization that's what I do 14:45 that's what I do 14:49 under budget and ahead of schedule 14:51 remember last week i opened the hotel 14:53 under budget and ahead of schedule 14:57 that was one of eight stops and I wanted 15:01 to see because they had my kids evanka 15:02 Donner they were in charge of the hotel 15:05 and I wanted two cities family yet 15:07 they're good they're good kids i will 15:09 say but I wanted to be there for the 15:12 ribbon cutting and Hillary said he took 15:15 time off from the campaign big I was 15:17 ever two seconds in the meantime I'm a 15:22 date stops stopped in Washington we cut 15:25 the ribbon it was beautiful it was great 15:28 and I said under budget and I wanted to 15:31 do it for that reason to really to 15:33 congratulate my kids going to be one of 15:35 the great hotels a lot of jobs a lot of 15:38 everything everything's good but one of 15:40 the great hotels the country will be 15:42 very proud of it 15:43 ok but what I really wanted to say is we 15:47 built it under budget and ahead of 15:49 schedule is that night 15:54 what we do things in the country 15:56 highways roadways we don't do too many 15:59 of them anymore we don't build bridges 16:00 anymore right we don't build tunnels 16:02 anymore but when we do things it's 16:04 always double triple quadruple the cost 16:07 it takes five times longer to build it 16:09 than you thought 16:10 so under budget and ahead of schedule we 16:13 will replace decades of failure with 16:17 generations of success we will bring 16:21 prosperity to our poorest communities 16:24 safety to our most dangerous 16:26 neighborhoods and hope to those places 16:29 which have not known hope in a very very 16:33 long time 16:37 New Mexico and you love New Mexico rate 16:43 man that's a lot of people will get a 16:48 bigger hanger next time I have a lot of 16:53 friends that live in New Mexico it's an 16:55 amazing place to Mexico has lost nearly 16:58 is the bad news forty percent of its 17:01 manufacturing jobs since bill clinton 17:04 signed NAFTA ideal strongly supported by 17:08 crooked Hillary America's lost seventy 17:13 thousand factories think about that is 17:15 seven i always say it's a typo seventy 17:18 thousand factories since what are they 17:21 having an alarm over what happened is 17:25 that an alarm garner there's so many 17:27 people in here at some alarm that's 17:30 alright let it run all night went 0 g 17:32 you know 17:33 I'll figure out how to turn it on 17:36 American particular America's lost 17:39 seventy thousand factories since China 17:42 entered the World Trade Organization 17:44 seventy thousand factories another 17:49 Hillary back deal we are living through 17:52 the greatest jobs theft in the history 17:55 of the world they're taking our jobs 17:57 they think we're babies 17:59 we're not going to allow it to happen 18:01 anymore 18:02 next hilary and her daughter's want the 18:06 trans-pacific partnership which will 18:08 destroy countless more jobs in New 18:11 Mexico another dip by the way the good 18:15 news is it will never be as bad as NAFTA 18:18 nothing can be mapped is the worst deal 18:20 ever side trade deal ever signed by any 18:24 country at any time but TPP is going to 18:28 be a disaster believe me overly complex 18:32 too many countries we want to make deals 18:35 one two three straight lines right and 18:38 of the country does it behave properly 18:40 we send them a notice of termination and 18:43 then they call us back and they give us 18:45 an even better deal 18:47 you have to see this you have to see 18:51 this trans-pacific it's all over the 18:53 place they don't know what they're doing 18:55 almost 6,000 pages and I guarantee you 18:58 like Obamacare our people don't even 19:00 read the pages a drop administration 19:04 will stop the trans-pacific partnership 19:06 renegotiating after and we're going to 19:09 stand up to China and China's currency 19:12 manipulation which is killing 19:14 and I have very good relations with 19:18 China there's nothing wrong 19:20 China's doing the right thing the only 19:22 thing wrong is that our politicians 19:23 allow them to get away with it 19:26 believable 19:27 we're going to start making things in 19:30 America again we are going to start very 19:37 importantly making things in New Mexico 19:40 again as part of our plan to bring back 19:46 jobs 19:47 we're going to lower taxes and American 19:49 businesses from 35% to fifteen percent 19:52 that means more companies opening up 19:58 their doors in New Mexico you will be 20:00 this place will be hot as a pistol I 20:03 promise it'll be hot as a pistol 20:07 we're going to massively cut taxes for 20:10 the middle class the middle class family 20:13 in New Mexico with two children will get 20:16 approximately a 35-percent tax cut 20:23 Hillary Clinton on the other hand is 20:25 going to raise your taxes by almost 20:27 fifty percent 20:30 and think of this with the highest taxed 20:33 nation in the world and she wants the 20:36 radio 20:36 yeah it's a really good idea raise taxes 20:38 go ahead with a lower your taxes big we 20:42 will also unleash your vast energy 20:44 resources in New Mexico to bring jobs 20:48 well and higher wages dias de we will 20:54 become a rich nation again at new mexico 20:59 will become a very very rich state 21:03 that's okay but to be rich country we 21:09 must also be a safe country violent 21:12 crime increased 53-percent in 21:15 Albuquerque last year did you know that 21:17 53-percent what's going on out there 21:20 what's happening 53-percent that's a lot 21:24 why why I'll tell you a big portion of 21:30 it but I honestly without having studied 21:33 it greatly i know the 53-percent number 21:35 you know the number drugs pouring into 21:38 New Mexico so we're going to stop that 21:42 now don't worry we're going to build the 21:44 wall don't worry about it 21:46 we're going to build 21:48 and Mexico is going to pay for the wall 21:51 and they'll be happy to know we have to 21:55 stop the drugs from pouring into our 21:57 country and poisoning our youth and 21:59 poisoning everybody else I'm going to 22:02 support our local and federal law 22:04 enforcement officials in order to reduce 22:06 violent drive in New Mexico that's a big 22:11 increase 53-percent that's about as big 22:15 as I've heard that's a big increase 22:17 every family in New Mexico has the right 22:19 to live in safety and peace you have 22:21 that right but Hillary Clinton also 22:26 wants a five hundred and fifty percent 22:29 increase in Syrian refugees coming into 22:32 account 22:37 Hillary's refugee plan means generations 22:40 of terrorism extremism and radicalism 22:44 spreading into your schools and into 22:47 your communities when we win we will 22:51 suspend the Syrian refugee program we 22:54 have no choice and we will keep radical 23:02 Islamic terrorists the hell out of our 23:05 country will have no tools a trump 23:16 administration will also secure and 23:18 defend the borders of the United States 23:20 as i said we will build the wall Mexico 23:25 will pay for the wall they'll be very 23:26 happy to do it 23:28 Mexico's making a fortune of the United 23:30 States we have tremendous trade deficit 23:32 with mexico will be very happy to pay 23:35 for the will just be just like rely on 23:37 me do you think I could do it folks will 23:39 I rely on we're gonna have a great 23:43 relationship with Mexico by the way but 23:46 it's gotta be a fair relationship you 23:48 know right now we have a one lane 23:49 highway going into Mexico 23:51 they've got our jobs we've got our 23:53 factories they've got our money they've 23:55 got everything you know we have drugs 23:58 and unemployment we've received the 24:01 first-ever endorsement from ice and from 24:04 the border patrol officers bigger dirt 24:07 they've never endorsed the presidential 24:10 candidate before and these are great 24:12 people that want to do their jobs you 24:14 know it'd be much easier working for 24:16 Obama a working for crooked Hillary 24:19 because frankly when you're working for 24:22 hilary she wants to let people just pour 24:25 in 24:25 you could have 650 million people pour 24:29 in and we do not think about thinking it 24:32 that's what could happen to triple the 24:37 size of our country and one wing once 24:40 you lose control of your borders you 24:42 have no country folks you just have to 24:44 and we want people to come into our 24:46 country just say it 24:47 I want people to come in and some should 24:50 come in through merit the merits of this 24:52 nothing wrong but we're gonna have big 24:54 beautiful doors in the wall and we're 24:57 going to have people come into our 24:58 country but they're going to come in 25:00 Legally right legal one of the come we 25:06 need people to come 25:08 Hillary's leadst open borders the 25:11 immigration officers one that Hillary's 25:13 plan is quote the most radical 25:15 immigration proposal ever put forward 25:18 because it's just open the immigration 25:21 office is also warned that Hillary's 25:23 radical plan would result in the loss 25:26 think it is of thousands of innocent 25:29 American lives and an uncontrollable 25:32 flood of illegal immigrants across the 25:34 border taking jobs and crime would be 25:37 rampant as we speak we were in the 25:40 middle of an unprecedented crisis on our 25:42 southern border the agents on the ground 25:45 says the worst they've ever seen and 25:48 that the American people are being told 25:50 the truth about what's happening but you 25:53 people know the truth because you're 25:54 here 25:56 people drugs and cartels are pouring 26:01 across the border this crisis is putting 26:04 enormous stress on your school's your 26:07 hospitals your jobs and your wages you 26:09 know that you know that I mean everybody 26:12 knows low income hispanic americans are 26:16 often those hurt the most by illegal 26:18 immigration which people are really now 26:20 seeing and we're doing so great with the 26:23 latino vote with the hispanic vote we 26:25 are doing you know it just came out 26:32 there was a story I was just giving the 26:35 Bay of Pigs Association Cuban just gave 26:38 me in Miami the award the great award an 26:41 unbelievable award just two days ago and 26:44 they just did a big story in Florida 26:45 because we're doing unbelievable the 26:47 lines are four blocks long they've never 26:49 seen anything like it at and everyone's 26:51 talking about you know Trump is getting 26:52 the hispanic vote what's going on 26:55 I do that I know 26:57 I know because people that are here 27:05 latina Hispanics people that are here 27:08 you want your house you want your job 27:11 you want all of these things that you 27:12 want security and safety i mean i 27:14 understand that but the Cubans gave me 27:17 their most coveted award and it was a 27:19 great honor will tell you that and we're 27:21 doing fantastic i will protect jobs for 27:26 hispanic and for the Hispanic American 27:30 community in New Mexico when I become 27:33 president we will keep the cartels and 27:35 the gang members out of New Mexico was 27:38 sending them back and we will protect 27:44 the jobs and security of every worker in 27:47 your state we're here to protect we're 27:50 here to bring jobs in CA plenty of 27:52 choice at lots of money we will also 27:55 repeal obama Clinton defensive question 27:57 rebuild our badly depleted military and 28:01 take care of our incredible veterans 28:15 how many veterans are here right now how 28:17 many batteries lot of veterans our 28:23 veterans have not been treated right you 28:25 know that we have 22 suicides a day 28:27 among the veteran community 22 said we 28:30 love you too i don't like guys sounds 28:32 pretty rough 28:33 he loves me he sounds very rough but i 28:36 still love 28:37 he's obviously a really are you a 28:40 veteran yes right 28:41 yes he's a veteran we're gonna take care 28:44 of our batters they haven't been taking 28:47 care but think of it 28:48 22 suicides a day you know there are two 28:53 numbers at stake out 22 suicides a day 28:56 you would think is not something that is 28:58 even thinkable right and the other is 29:01 when you have 70,000 factories that have 29:04 left our country and for those two 29:06 numbers i thought that was a typo and 29:08 the 22 suicide today I had a check i 29:11 have to say that is that possible but 29:13 the weights are so long to see a doctor 29:15 sometimes two weeks but you wait for 56 29:19 days to see a doctor and a little 29:21 prescription a little a little procedure 29:24 could save your life and these are 29:27 veterans easily the greatest people in 29:29 our country 29:30 we're going to take care of our veterans 29:31 for the first time because they have not 29:36 protected there was a story recently 29:39 couple of weeks ago about a highly 29:42 decorated veteran who lived out of a 29:45 dumpster in a certain area of our 29:47 country lived out of a dumpster 29:49 that's not gonna be happening anymore 29:51 folks we will rebuild our badly depleted 29:54 Air Force the smallest and oldest it has 29:58 ever been 29:59 that means massive new investments 30:02 together here place called kirkland 30:05 kirkland Kirtland Air Force Base right 30:10 here in New Mexico a lot of investment 30:12 going there is a great base to by the 30:14 way we also need a new foreign policy 30:17 that puts America first Hilary brought 30:22 disaster to Iraq Syria Libya and every 30:26 place that she touches she empowered 30:28 Iran and she Unleashed Isis by leaving 30:32 that big vacuum and you know I tell the 30:35 story of Muslim I tell the story of both 30:38 you know we had mosel until Obama and 30:41 Hillary got out and then they took 30:43 puzzle back but we had now we're 30:45 fighting again but I tell the story 30:47 why can't we use the element of surprise 30:50 four for four months we've all been 30:54 hearing we will be attacking mosel in 30:56 four months i said why you doing this 30:58 why you saying why do you have the top 31:00 then I here three months were going to 31:02 attack it three months too much one 31:03 month then couple weeks tired and one me 31:06 why way we're going into muscle and then 31:09 I said to myself why are they doing is 31:11 why don't they use the element of 31:13 surprise 31:14 General MacArthur general george patton 31:17 bomb you know what they're doing right 31:19 there spinning in their graves they 31:20 can't even believe it very tough and you 31:23 know one of the reasons they wanted 31:25 muzzle the Isis leaders that we do have 31:27 to take Isis out you know that it's 31:29 going to take them we want peace through 31:33 strength we don't want to be in wars but 31:35 these savages are chopping off heads 31:39 drowning people in steel cage is bearing 31:42 people in the sand 31:44 we haven't had this is medieval times 31:47 this is video bowl x and then we can't 31:50 do waterboarding it's far too tough 31:52 hidden we're fighting on a different 31:54 level 31:55 see were fighting on a different level 31:56 clubs and we have to be tough and we 31:59 have to be smart and we have to be in 32:01 some

32:14 trillion dollars in the Middle East six 32:16 trillion dollars and we could have 32:19 rebuilt our country twice six trillion 32:22 dollars and you know what the Middle 32:24 East isn't far worse shape than from our 32:26 standpoint if our presidents would have 32:29 gone away little drama go play golf 32:31 every day I won't mention other names 32:35 but if our presidents would have

Isis for hillary was there and 34:01 now you listen to her we will stop Isis 34:03 she's got zero chance Isis his biggest 34:05 dream is that Hillary Clinton crooked 34:08 Hillary becomes president of

country 37:30 that i can tell you 37:32 nra so to have their endorsement is very 37:35 important but believe me your second 37:37 Amendment is under siege underseas and 37:40 with me 37:41 there will be no underseas I promise you 37:47 and we will appoint justices to the 37:51 United States Supreme Court who will 37:53 uphold and defend the Constitution of 37:56 the morning 38:04 Hillary Clinton wants us to think small 38:08 wants us to believe things can change 38:10 and what's your life to revolve and 38:13 that's so true 38:15 she wants our lives to revolve around 38:17 washington DC i'm asking you to dream 38:22 big remember the old days three big our 38:27 country used to dream big to push for 38:30 bold change and to believe in a movement 38:33 powered by the people and by their love 38:36 for this country and it's true even 38:42 these really dishonest video people the 38:44 world's most dishonest 38:52 don't worry don't worry you won't be on 38:55 television they never show they never 38:57 show the crowd you know that you've been 38:59 hearing me said they never ever want to 39:02 show these massive crowds 39:20 these are among the most dishonest 39:23 people on earth

football 39:36 game right 39:44 amazing 39:55 very dishonest that very dishonest 40:00 people the other night at 17,000 people 40:03 at an event and one of the anchors were 40:05 saying we're here at the donald trump 40:08 rallies got a few thousand people a few 40:10 thousand is that you know what a few 40:12 thousand people is not 17,000 people a 40:16 few thousand people to me is 3,000 40:18 people okay but there is a level of 40:21 dishonesty that I would never believe is 40:24 possible but we're gonna win we're going 40:27 to win 40:34 I've led a great life now I want to give 40:39 back to the country and this country has 40:42 been so good to me i love this country 40:46 and I was on the other side i was on the 40:49 other side for a long time but I love 40:51 this country and is always happening and 40:53 we were going in the wrong direction and 40:56 i went from like the ultimate insider to 41:00 probably the ultimate outsider would you 41:02 say i love spent over a hundred million 41:08 dollars of my money on doing this and a 41:11 lot of people they say the greatest 41:13 political phenomena they've ever seen 41:15 they say but you know what 41:17 and somebody one of them actually said 41:20 to be it doesn't matter 41:21 listen to this one it doesn't matter if 41:23 you win or lose 41:24 what you've done is created something 41:26 that's never happened in this country 41:28 before let me tell you right now if we 41:30 lose in november eight I have wasted 41:33 tremendous time energy and money 41:36 political believe me it will be a total 41:39 waste of time energy but I saw what was 41:44 happening and i'm with you I've spent a 41:47 career finding the untapped potential in 41:50 projects and people all over the world 41:53 everywhere I look at this country all i 41:56 see is on tapped potential waiting to be 42:00 set 42:03 I'm tired of politicians telling 42:06 Americans to defer their dreams to 42:09 another day when they really mean 42:11 deferred their dreams to another decade 42:14 you know that America is tired of 42:19 waiting the moment is now we're never 42:22 going to have another chance forget four 42:24 years from now it's not gonna happen 42:27 this is almost like you could say a 42:29 miracle that's taking place 42:31 knock on wood almost a miracle that's 42:35 taking place where leading in the polls 42:39 we're leading
