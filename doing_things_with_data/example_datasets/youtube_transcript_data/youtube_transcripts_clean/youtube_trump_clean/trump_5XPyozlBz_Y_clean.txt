countries not gonna happen anymore 4:31 we're going to tell you why but not 4:32 gonna happen earlier today I outlined my 4:36 contract with the American voter a 4:39 detailed list of solutions to make your 4:43 life richer and better one of the issues 4:48 i addressed at length is the issue of 4:51 government corruption I talked about the 4:54 inside dealing the powerful protecting 4:57 the powerful and about special interests 5:00 and owners who rigged the system the 5:04 system is Rick you know it I know it 5:09 the politicians know it the media people 5:12 know it 5:13 they all know 5:18 I've talked about the corrupt career 5:21 lifetime politicians like Hillary 5:23 Clinton selling her office for personal 5:26 enrichment and you've seen how that's 5:29 going 5:30 I've got news for all of the people 5:32 taking advantage of our rigged system in 5:36 17 days everything is going to change 6:00 in 17 days we are going to drain the 6:04 swamp of corruption in Washington DC we 6:11 are going to renegotiate our terrible 6:14 trade deals and illegal immigration stop 6:18 the massive inflow of refugees coming 6:21 from the Middle East reduce surging 6:25 crime cut taxes and regulations unleash 6:30 American energy including shale oil 6:33 natural gas and beautiful clean coal 6:38 we're going to put those miners back to 6:42 work 6:43 we will rebuild our military and take 6:46 care of our great veterans and that 6:49 means new aircraft for wright-patterson 6:52 air force base right here in Ohio 7:01 we will also repeal and replace the 7:05 total disaster known as Obamacare 7:13 health insurance premiums are going 7:15 through the roof led by Obamacare and 7:18 companies are being driven out of 7:20 business they're leaving our country 7:22 over the cost of healthcare it is a 7:25 total disaster 7:27 many companies are being forced to flee 7:30 fire everybody flee go to another 7:34 country 7:35 we're going to stop it day one and 7:37 Hillary Clinton wants to double down and 7:40 make Obamacare bigger and even worse 7:47 just this month the Democratic governor 7:50 of minnesota admitted the reality is the 7:54 Affordable Care Act he said is no longer 7:57 affordable he said that and you probably 8:00 saw last week Bill Clinton called 8:03 Obamacare the craziest thing in the 8:06 world 8:07 he said that small businesses and 8:09 middle-class Americans are getting 8:11 killed 8:13 he then went home and he got killed he 8:19 tried taking it back the next day he did 8:24 not have the same enthusiasm he was he 8:28 had a rough evening 8:30 that was a tough favor but look whether 8:33 you are 8:33 Hillary Clinton or anybody else 8:37 Obamacare is a disaster premiums are 8:39 going up sixty seventy eighty ninety 8:43 percent next year it's going to be worse 8:45 you know at a certain point and it's 8:48 lousy healthcare terrible the 8:51 deductibles is so high I mean you don't 8:55 want to use it anyway but if you need it 8:58 you'll never get to use it because the 9:00 deductibles have gotten so high so it's 9:02 a horror show 9:03 we're going to repeal it and replace it 9:10 and this is our chance to get rid of 9:14 this law but we're going to approve and 9:20 get something that is so much less 9:23 expensive and so good a great healthcare 9:26 system a system that you deserve that's 9:30 what we're going to be doing and that's 9:32 one of many things folks we have so many 9:35 things we can stand here for two days 9:37 and just talk but we're going to go over 9:40 a lot of them among our reforms 10:10 is he one of the people paid for by the 10:14 Democrats and the Clinton campaign and 10:16 you paid get out of here get out out get 10:20 out 10:28 did you read that the other day they 10:30 paid $1,500 they're violent they want to 10:36 have violence and everybody blamed it on 10:38 me and now they're saying guess what 10:40 Trump was actually innocent unbelievable 10:43 unbelievable among our reforms will be 10:47 to cut the red tape at the FDA and speed 10:51 the approval of life-saving drugs your 10:55 jobs will come back under a trump 10:57 administration your incomes will go up 11:02 under a trump administration your taxes 11:06 will go way down under a trump 11:09 administration and she's going to raise 11:12 your taxes your company's won't be 11:17 leaving Ohio under a trump 11:20 administration they won't be going 11:23 believe me to another country where 11:25 they're offered a little bit better deal 11:27 you'll be proud of your leaders once 11:31 again now WikiLeaks shows us that John 11:35 Podesta said Hillary Clinton has bad 11:39 instincts Bernie Sanders said she has 11:42 bad judgment 11:44 what are we doing folks these people 11:46 work with her 11:47 what are we doing one of her closest 11:49 allies said she doesn't seem to know 11:52 what planet were all living in this is 11:56 her allies saying this the emails also 12:00 show her staff saying she has no core 12:05 she has no for that's because she just 12:09 does whatever her donors and special 12:12 interests water to do 12:36 we're not too happy with her i will tell 12:39 you look it's a rigged system that's how 12:44 she got to run a rigged system the whole 12:47 entire purpose of her campaign is to 12:50 keep our system rigged and to stop 12:53 change from happening at any cost and we 12:56 need change 12:57 we are about change she is about keeping 13:01 it the way it is and we don't want to 13:03 have four more years of Obama that we 13:06 can tell you just take a look at a 13:09 record she hasn't been there think of 13:12 this 13:13 she's been there for 30 years and hasn't 13:16 fixed anything she's unleashed death 13:21 destruction and failure in every country 13:25 she touched in the Middle East Iraq 13:28 Libya Syria Iran Hillary's catastrophic 13:33 values unleashed Isis right 13:36 the great vacuum that she and obama 13:38 created which is now on a campaign of 13:42 genocide against Christians in the 13:44 Middle East and all over the world there 13:47 in 32 countries when they started during 13:51 her tenure as Secretary of State when 13:55 they started they started as a little 13:58 group remember the JV Obama called him 14:01 the JV there now in 32 countries and now 14:05 i watch Hillary Clinton says I'm going 14:07 to stop Isis why didn't she stop it in 14:10 the first place 14:11 why did she let it start 14:17 when will she take responsibility for 14:21 all of the death and suffering and 14:23 bloodshed she caused all around the 14:25 world look at what she's done when will 14:28 she apologized for all of the people her 14:31 decisions have gotten killed at home she 14:35 failed on the economy and she failed in 14:38 upstate New York she said in the Senate 14:41 she's going to bring jobs elect me guess 14:44 what the place emptied out companies 14:49 like carrier firing their workers and 14:51 moving to Mexico Ford is moving all of 14:55 its small car production to Mexico who 14:59 knows better than Cleveland what's going 15:01 on 15:02 who knows look at this place who knows 15:05 better than Cleveland and right next 15:07 door you're losing another big monster 15:09 and they're moving to mexico i hope you 15:12 know that but they're moving to Mexico 15:14 we're gonna stop it folks were going to 15:16 stop it dead in its tracks 15:24 when I'm president if companies want to 15:27 fire their workers and leave for Mexico 15:30 or some other place then we will charge 15:33 them a 35-percent tax when they want to 15:36 ship their products back into the United 15:39 States 15:46 and when they hear that they're not 15:47 moving now they may move to another 15:50 state that's different right 15:53 you gotta fight for your own right but 15:56 they're not moving to these other 15:58 countries and firing all of their people 16:01 you have to see the numbers it was 16:04 77,000 factories 77,000 Hillary Clinton 16:10 has raised countless millions of dollars 16:13 from big donors who want to ship our 16:15 jobs to these other countries the system 16:20 is rigged and the best evidence of that 16:23 is that Hillary Clinton is even allowed 16:27 to run for the office of President in 16:30 the first place 16:35 she lied to congress under oath she lied 16:39 to the FBI and she made 13 phones 16:43 disappear 16:45 many of them by whacking them with a 16:47 hammer 16:53 how many people have made your phone's 16:56 disappear and whack them out with a 16:59 hammer anybody here 17:00 oh no is a guy right up here sir 17:04 what business are you in I don't want to 17:06 know she bleached and deleted 33,000 17:12 emails and then two crucial boxes of 17:16 email evidence is now mysteriously 17:19 missing two weeks ago 17:25 her actions with her illegal server have 17:28 put every single American family at risk 17:32 she is the most corrupt person ever to 17:35 seek the presidency of the United States 17:38 her career embodies what the American 17:44 people love about corrupt self-serving 17:48 establishment that is stripped this 17:50 country of its jobs is wealth and his 17:53 opportunity and we're going to turn it 17:56 around and we're really going to turn it 17:58 around 17:59 that's not just words her campaign even 18:05 mocks Catholics and evangelicals 18:11 who is Catholic in this room well I know 18:16 you're not voting for who is evangelical 18:19 in this road wow she's in trouble 18:24 I know you're not voting for and she 18:28 smears police offices as essentially 18:31 races and she smears all of you as 18:34 deplorable and irredeemable 18:40 she eagerly takes millions of dollars 18:42 from countries that murder and oppressed 18:45 women gays and people of different 18:48 faiths and refuses to give all of that 18:52 money back fact I brought that up in the 18:56 debate by the way how badly did we beat 18:59 her in the debate 19:06 that wasn't a close one we will defend 19:09 religious liberty and we will defend the 19:12 rights of all people then then then then 19:18 there is the issue that everybody's is 19:21 all 19:22 oh it doesn't take place are these 19:25 people playing games with us right 19:29 oh it doesn't take place these are the 19:32 people that negotiate our trade deals 19:35 these are the people that don't know 19:37 what's going on in real life or these 19:39 are the people that are just playing 19:41 games with you there is the issue of 19:44 voter fraud is it amazing the way they 19:49 say there's no voter from folks is a 19:52 rigged system and it's a rigged election 19:56 believe me 19:57 according to the highly respected pew 20:02 there are 24 million voter registrations 20:07 in the united states that are either 20:09 invalid or significantly inaccurate lot 20:14 right 20:15 24 million lot there a 1.8 million dead 20:21 people that are registered right now to 20:24 vote and folks spokes some of them vote 20:30 i wonder why I wonder how that happened 20:32 they woke up from the dead and they went 20:35 and voted there a 2.8 million people 20:41 that are registered in more than one 20:44 state so we'll vote here let's write 20:47 down the road let's vote next maybe the 20:50 shop i don't know maybe I shouldn't be 20:52 saved 20:53 I may be hurting myself you're right 21:01 you're right maybe they're gonna vote 21:02 for Trump alright let's forget that it's 21:04 okay for them to do it 21:07 fourteen percent of non-citizens are 21:09 registered to vote 21:11 the system is also rigged by the media 21:14 WikiLeaks Jones 21:24 WikiLeaks shows the media colluding and 21:26 conspiring directly with the Clinton 21:29 campaign emails even show that Clinton's 21:33 boasting gleefully about very friendly 21:37 and malleable reporters who shower the 21:40 Clintons with praise 21:42 I know the people they're talking about 21:43 to us they're very dishonest for 21:48 instance those cameras they'll never 21:50 show these crowds they'll never showed 21:58 it's all rigged but on november eight 22:00 we're going to show them and we're going 22:02 to beat the system 22:12 and we will end the corruption in 22:17 Washington we will make America great 22:22 again you want we could also end 22:29 economic stagnation in our country at 22:34 the center of my jobs where we'll be 22:37 fixing our terrible terrible terrible 22:39 trade deals we have nearly and 800 22:45 billion dollar annual trade deficit with 22:48 the world in other words we deal with 22:51 the world we have a deficit of 800 22:55 billion dollars you know in the audience 22:57 I have a lot of friends there from this 22:59 area they're all great business people i 23:02 could put any one of them in charge and 23:05 we could do well but the people we have 23:08 negotiating the biggest deals in the 23:10 world of political hacks like the Iran 23:13 deal 23:14 how bad was the Iran deal 23:20 how bad was and how about when we gave 23:24 them four hundred million in cash to get 23:27 the 150 billion we gave him four hundred 23:33 million dollars in cash but we were 23:35 wrong it was actually 1.7 billion in 23:39 cash 23:40 you know what that fill up the whole 23:41 side of this room also remember this is 23:47 and you don't hear that from these 23:49 characters 23:50 this is the worst so-called recovery 23:53 that we've had in this country since the 23:57 Great Depression Ohio and just look at 24:02 this building but look at all the other 24:04 buildings around it 24:06 ohio was lost one in three of its 24:08 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA a deal 24:12 signed by bill clinton and supported by 24:15 crooked Hillary Clinton 24:21 Hillary visit states like Ohio 24:23 Pennsylvania and Michigan talks about 24:26 jobs but she's the one who killed the 24:30 jobs in the first place 24:32 why didn't she do something about you 24:34 probably saw in the debate she say well 24:37 I want to do this I want to do that I 24:39 want to do this I said why didn't you do 24:41 it you've been there for 30 years why 24:42 did you do it it's just talk its 24:46 political talk it's all talk no action 24:50 it's like a bank robber visiting the 24:54 scene of a crime 24:55 we've lost seventy thousand factories 24:57 since china's entry into the World Trade 25:01 Organization you know when I saw the 25:03 70,000 number 25:05 honestly I thought it was a typo said 25:07 70,000 think about 70,000 is you know 25:11 here we're talking for in this area 25:14 70,000 throughout our country I thought 25:17 it was a type of its not a type of we've 25:19 lost seventy thousand factories another 25:23 bill and hillary backed disaster 25:26 we're living through the greatest jobs 25:30 theft in the history of the world 25:32 there's no other country that has ever 25:35 been rated like our country has been 25:38 rated of its jobs and its money and its 25:40 wealth we owe 20 trillion dollars it 25:44 doubled think of it it doubled in just 25:48 eight years a little less it doubled 25:53 think of it a drop administration is 25:56 going to renegotiate NAFTA stand up too 26:00 far and cheating and stop the jobs from 26:03 leaving our country 26:10 and we are going to stop currency 26:12 manipulation the number one game they 26:15 play their grand masters but we're going 26:17 to stop currency manipulation because 26:20 that's cheating and our companies cannot 26:23 compete with that we are going to start 26:26 making things again in America as part 26:31 of our plan to bring back our jobs 26:33 we're going to lower our business tax 26:36 from thirty-five percent which is the 26:38 highest anywhere in the world to fifteen 26:41 percent which is among the lows 26:46 we are also going to rebuild our inner 26:50 cities and you know about that 26:52 african-americans and Hispanics living 26:57 in the inner cities are suffering very 27:00 badly and very unfairly the violence is 27:04 unbearable and unbelievable you walk to 27:09 the store with your child and you get 27:11 shot there is no education there are no 27:15 jobs and there is no safety nearly 3,500 27:19 people have been shot in the city of 27:22 Chicago since the beginning of the can 27:25 you believe that 3,500 people that's 27:28 worse than these war zones are seeing 27:29 homicides are up nearly fifty percent in 27:33 Washington DC and more than sixty 27:36 percent in Baltimore and it's getting 27:39 worse so to the african-american 27:41 community and to the Hispanic community 27:46 and voters I say what do you have to 27:51 lose 27:52 vote for Donald Trump I will fix it 27:56 I well 28:05 through 28:06 true 28:08 so true we will be a rich nation again 28:14 a woman came up to me recently she said 28:17 mr. Trump I love listening to you speak 28:19 but I hate it when you say we will be 28:22 rich again as a nation i say i'm sorry 28:25 but if we're not going to be rich again 28:27 we're gonna lose all of those things 28:29 because i'm going to save your Social 28:32 Security with Hillary she's going to cut 28:34 it to pieces and we're leaving it the 28:38 way it is because that was the contract 28:40 you made but Hillary is going to cut it 28:42 to pieces so many things so I said to 28:44 look I know it doesn't sound politically 28:48 correct or nice but we are going to be a 28:51 rich nation again we have to go to do 28:56 what we want to do because we have to 28:58 build up our military we have to do so 29:00 many things but to be rich nation we 29:03 must also be a safe Nation national 29:07 security begins at the border speaking 29:11 and secrets to a foreign back Hillary 29:13 Clinton said her dream is for totally 29:16 open trade there go your jobs and open 29:20 borders there goes your country 29:23 there goes 29:26 WikiLeaks WikiLeaks 29:49 we will build the wall 29:55 and who is going to pay for the wall who 30:01 now we're going to build the wall 30:07 Mexico's gonna pay for the way you know 30:09 Mexico you talk about trade deficits 30:11 Mexico is making a fortune off the 30:14 United States and they're great people 30:17 that great people and they have 30:19 leadership that's smarter more cunning 30:21 sharper than our leaders but we have a 30:24 massive trade deficit with mexico and 30:27 i'm not talking about the drugs that are 30:29 pouring into poisoning our youth in Ohio 30:31 and New Hampshire and Pennsylvania and 30:34 Virginia and everyplace else we're gonna 30:37 build a wall we're going to stop the 30:39 poison from boring in we're going to do 30:43 things that will make you so proud 30:45 we're going to be proud of our country 30:48 again anyone who supports open borders 30:50 can never be and should never be allowed 30:53 to be the president of the united states 30:56 and she supports open 31:01 with that radical pledge Hillary Clinton 31:06 betrayed every single citizen of the 31:08 United States as she's been doing for 31:10 many years and as he certainly did with 31:14 her emails and her servers and all of 31:17 the illegal things and she's also open 31:20 the door to unlimited drugs pouring into 31:23 your community which Ohio does not want 31:28 you have a big problem you have a big 31:32 problem with you know a four-star 31:36 general general Cartwright highly 31:38 respected four-star we're talking 31:40 top-of-the-line highly respected man two 31:44 days ago was severely criticized and 31:49 we'll probably have to serve almost five 31:51 years in prison for lying to the FBI and 31:57 he said he did it for national security 31:59 reasons and I understand that but he 32:03 lied one time to the FBI Hillary Clinton 32:07 lied so many times nobody can count that 32:11 high 32:14 so said 32:22 so said and you look at General Petraeus 32:25 General Petraeus was was severely 32:30 sanctioned General Petraeus his life was 32:33 essentially destroyed for doing a tiny 32:37 fraction of what Hillary Clinton did a 32:40 tiny fraction look at general Cartwright 32:44 look at General Petraeus and these are 32:46 great men and look what happened to them 32:49 their lives are destroyed and they did 32:51 nothing nothing compared to what Hillary 32:56 Clinton and look at all of the other 32:58 people over the years and have suffered 33:00 grave consequences and they did nothing 33:03 compared to what she's done Hillary's 33:05 plan includes an open border with the 33:08 Middle East meeting generations of 33:11 radicalism and terrorism spreading and 33:14 growing within your communities and near 33:17 your families and most people don't even 33:20 know where they're going including 33:21 governors and Senators nobody knows this 33:26 is going to be the great Trojan horse 33:29 and you have to say I've been very good 33:30 at predicting things so let me state 33:34 this as clearly as I can if I'm elected 33:38 president I'm going to keep radical 33:42 Islamic terrorists the hell out of our 33:46 country 34:16 we will also stop the crisis of illegal 34:20 immigration a trump administration will 34:25 secure and defend our borders and i said 34:31 before we'll build the wall but will do 34:34 much more than build the wall 34:36 we're going to use a lot of this we're 34:39 going to be tough 34:40 we're going to be vigilant we're going 34:41 to be smart we have the first-ever 34:44 endorsement from our ice and Border 34:47 Patrol officers 16,500 these are great 34:53 Americans and they want to do their job 34:55 right and the amazing thing is their job 34:58 is so much easier if Hillary got in 35:00 because all they have to do is stand 35:02 there let the people walk right in front 35:04 with me they have to work and that's 35:06 what they want to do because they know 35:08 what's happening better than any 35:10 consultants we could hire and pay 35:12 millions of dollars they tell you in two 35:14 minutes what's happening and I said to 35:17 him how important is the wall and they 35:19 said mr. Trump it's very very important 35:22 especially for the stoppage of drug flow 35:24 coming into our country it's very very 35:27 good 35:31 as secretary of state hillary clinton 35:35 allowed thousands of criminal aliens to 35:37 be released because their home countries 35:40 would not take them back 35:43 these are gang members these are killers 35:47 these are drug dealers we bring them 35:49 back to their home country and their 35:51 country said very intelligently we don't 35:54 want them take them out of here we won't 35:56 accept them 35:57 I promise you as president there won't 36:00 be one such instance those people will 36:05 be gladly accepted by their home it was 36:10 just reported that a man deported from 36:12 our country 10 times in six years has 36:15 been charged with raping a 36:16 twelve-year-old girl in August texas 36:19 police arrested a serial illegal 36:24 immigrant rapist who had been deported 36:26 five times his victims included 1 68 36:30 year-old woman with a cane who took his 36:33 offer to drive him home he left her on 36:36 the side of a dirt road in horrible 36:40 horrible condition to 64 year old Air 36:44 Force veteran Maryland Ferris an
