10:28 president i'll tell you right there 10:31 she is the most corrupt person ever to 10:33 seek the presidency of the United States 10:37 my contract with the American voter 10:40 begins with a plan to end government 10:42 corruption and to take our country back 10:44 from the special interests and donors 10:51 I want the entire corrupt Washington 10:54 establishment to hear our words as we 10:58

and it's not a good 11:19 thing it's not pretty at the core of my 11:22 contract is my plan to bring jobs back 11:25 to our country 11:28 America has lost one third of its 11:31 manufacturing job since NAFTA a deal 11:35 originally signed by bill clinton and 11:39 supported by Hillary America is lost 11:44 70,000 factory since China entered the 11:48 World Trade Organization another bill 11:50 and hillary back disaster Minnesota 11:54 ranks for nationwide for the highest 11:58 share of jobs lost due to our trade 12:01 deficit with China did you know that 12:03 your fourth at least you're not first 12:07 and then going to vote for the people 12:09 that did that to you 12:10 I don't know 12:13 why do I feel good about minnesota 12:20 I'll tell you one thing I'll tell you 12:23 one thing if I don't win Minnesota I'm 12:28 gonna look real bad to those pundits 12:30 that I do not respect very much 12:33 and there are some of them right up 12:35 there the world's most dishonest people 12:37 the media totally dishonest 12:46 they are the dishonest people they send 12:49 a camera outside to take a look at the 12:51 crowd also and when Hillary Clinton was 12:57 Secretary of State our trade deficit 13:01 with china grew 40-percent great job 13:03 Hilary with living through the greatest 13:06 jobs left in the history of the world 13:10 no country has ever lost jobs like we've 13:13 lost jobs for laid off 794 workers and 13:18 st. Paul and move their jobs overseas 13:21 moneygram laid off 408 workers in 13:25 brooklyn center and move their jobs 13:27 overseas Greatbatch laid off 200 workers 13:32 and plymouth and move their jobs like so 13:35 many others to Mexico 13:40 not gonna happen folks any more children 13:42 over 13:47 speed manufacturing later 592 people in 13:52 Hastings and move their jobs to Mexico 13:55 IBN later 500 workers in minneapolis and 14:00 move their jobs to India and various 14:03 other countries a trump administration 14:06 will stop the jobs from leaving America 14:08 and we will stop the jobs from leaving 14:13 Minnesota and we'll stop them 14:15 immediately 14:18 one of the reasons i ran one of the main 14:23 reasons i ran and so simple if a company 14:27 wants to leave Minnesota fire their 14:30 workers and moved to another country and 14:32 then ship their products back into the 14:35 United States through what will be a 14:38 very very strong border I promise you 14:41 we will make them pay a 35-percent tax 14:46 on those product 14:51 and I'll tell you what will happen not 14:54 very complicated they won't move 14:56 they're not going to both then I can 14:58 move our politicians are controlled by 15:03 special interests donors and others some 15:07 of them are very bright 15:09 you know you've been hearing this for 15:10 years how do we stop this terrible 15:12 outflow they could've stopped that most 15:15 people don't even think of these things 15:16 but let me tell you you put a tax on 15:19 those products when they make them they 15:21 want to move to Mexico the whole 15:23 different ball game folks they're not 15:24 leaving this thing with you and when we 15:27 lower taxes on business which were going 15:29 to do we're going to start new 15:31 businesses businesses will expand could 15:33 have a lot of jobs we will also unleash 15:36 American energy including shale oil 15:40 natural gas and clean call going to put 15:45 miners back to work 15:47 we're going to put our steel workers 15:48 back to work 15:51 we will also cancel all harmful Obama 15:54 regulations that hurt minnesota farmers 15:56 workers and small businesses big-league 16:00 you've been hurt 16:03 I'll tell you know honestly because i 16:06 was looking at the stats i have like a 16:09 lot of time on airplanes so I look at 16:11 stats doesn't sound like a very exciting 16:14 life but it is actually but Minnesota 16:17 has really been hurt so I say what the 16:21 hell do you want to put these same 16:22 people back into office for to say 16:27 we're gonna be great for Minnesota you 16:30 become a rich nation again but to be 16:34 rich nation we must also be a safe 16:38 nation and you know what's going on 16:41 Oh Minnesota our Minnesota you know 16:46 what's going on you know what I'm 16:47 talking about do you know what I'm 16:50 talking about 16:51 I'll be politically correct just not 16:55 quietly not the whole world knows what's 16:59 happening in Minnesota the whole world 17:02 knows what's happening to you 17:05 Hilary wants a five hundred and fifty 17:07 percent increase in Syrian refugees 17:10 pouring into our country and she wants 17:15 virtually unlimited immigration and 17:17 refugee admissions from the most 17:20 dangerous regions of the world to come 17:23 into our country and to come into 17:25 Minnesota and you know it better than 17:27 anybody 17:31 her plan will import generations of 17:33 terrorism extremism and radicalism into 17:38 your schools and throughout your 17:40 communities your dad when I'm elected 17:45 president we will suspend this Syrian 17:49 refugee program and we will keep radical 17:54 Islamic terrorists the hell out of our 17:59 country 18:19 how stupid how stupid are our leaders 18:23 have stupid they to allow this to happen 18:25 here in Minnesota you've seen firsthand 18:28 the problems caused with faulty refugee 18:32 vetting with large numbers of Somali 18:36 refugees coming into you state without 18:39 your knowledge without your supporter 18:42 approval and with some of them then 18:45 joining Isis and spreading their 18:47 extremist views all over our country and 18:49 all over the world 18:55 honestly it's hard to believe it's hard 18:58 to believe and everybody's reading about 19:00 the disaster taking place in Minnesota 19:03 everybody's reading about it you don't 19:05 even have the right to talk about it you 19:07 don't even know who's coming in you have 19:09 no idea 19:10 you'll find out you'll find that you've 19:13 seen the recent terrorist knife attack 19:16 in st. cloud a trump administration will 19:20 not admit any refugees without the 19:24 support of the local community where 19:27 they are being place 19:36 the least they could do for you you've 19:39 suffered enough in Minnesota and we will 19:42 pause admissions from Terra prone 19:44 regions until a full security assessment 19:48 has been performed and until a proven 19:51 vetting mechanism has been established 19:59 horrible what they do horrible 20:04 and if you want people to just for into 20:06 Minnesota all you have to do is vote for 20:08 Hillary Clinton because that's what 20:09 she's gonna do just about 20:14 and I don't care where you come from I 20:16 don't care how liberal you are 20:18 I don't care how politically correct you 20:20 are how stupid this has been how stupid 20:24 it's better and you get the brunt of it 20:26 almost more than any other place 20:31 a trump administration will also secure 20:34 and defend the borders of the United 20:36 States and yes we will build a great 20:40 wall 20:59 Hillary supports totally open borders 21:02 there goes your country and strongly 21:07 support sanctuary cities like San 21:10 Francisco where Kate Steinle was 21:12 murdered by an illegal immigrant 21:15 deported at least five times thousands 21:18 of Americans would be alive today if not 21:21 for the open border policies of Obama 21:24 Clinton 21:27 there's the tragic case of 90 year old 21:30 Earl orland a Minnesota farm who was 21:35 brutally beaten by illegal immigrants 21:37 and left to bleed to death at his home 21:39 girl's body was found with his hands 21:43 bound behind his back 21:45 duct tape on his mouth and blunt force 21:48 injuries all over his head his killers 21:52 had criminal records a mile long but 21:55 they did not meet the Obama 21:57 administration's priorities for removal 22:00 and yet everybody that knew these 22:03 killers everybody that knew them said 22:06 please please get them out they should 22:10 be incarcerated 22:11 don't let them roam our communities 22:16 a drunk administration will end this 22:18 nightmare of violence that you're having 22:20 and that plenty of others have 22:25 we will stop illegal immigration deport 22:29 all criminal aliens and dismantle every 22:32 last criminal gang in cartel threatening 22:35 our citizens 22:39 we will also repeal the obama-clinton 22:44 defense sequester the great deal they 22:47 make and rebuild our badly depleted 22:50 military 22:56 we thought flying jets are almost 20 22:59 years old fighter jets they don't even 23:01 make the parts they go down to the 23:04 airplane graveyards an airplane museums 23:07 to get parts for these planes they don't 23:09 make them anymore 23:10 that's what this country of ours the 23:12 united states of america that's what 23:15 we're flying 23:17 embarrassing embarrassment for a great 23:20 great young pilots and all of the people 23:22 that are in our armed services
