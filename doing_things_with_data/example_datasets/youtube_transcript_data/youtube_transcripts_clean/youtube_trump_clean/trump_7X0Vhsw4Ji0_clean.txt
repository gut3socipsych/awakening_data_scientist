it's indicative of your love for the greatest country in the world the 12:14 United States and I i want to say just a moment about Donald Trump Donald Trump 12:27 is national he's international he's not just an American he's a World Figure 12:36 he's known all over the world 12:39 Donald Trump put a lot of businesses together united states around the world 12:48 a lot of businesses created a lot of jobs thousands of jobs for people around 12:55 the world and there's something when when I coached we had to do two things 13:02 we had to have good players and we had to solve problems we had to figure out 13:09 how to beat the press we had to figure out how to beat the zone defense we had 13:15 to do a lot of things there's nobody that I've met in my lifetime that has a 13:21 better grasp of how to correct mistakes and how to look at what's wrong and how 13:29 to correct what's wrong and how to get it going right and i think that is the 13:35 most important thing that can be brought to the next president of the United 13:40 States and there's nobody who has a better background in correcting things 13:47 that are going wrong and getting things going in the right direction and 13:51 developing those things the best person ever has been Donald Trump 13:57 yeah 14:05 believe me when I tell you I think you're all going green on this our next 14:13 president is going to inherit a hell of a lot of problems and it's going to take 14:21 a problem solver to get us back where we want to be and where we should be and 14:29 there is no one that even comes close to being smart tough and dedicated 14:40 completely to the United States of America 14:44 let's put Donald Trump in that position so he can get us back where we belong 14:59 this guy is going to have to deal with a lot of things he's gonna have to deal 15:04 and inherit a national debt larger than we've ever had 15:10 he's gonna have to deal with immigration problems and on and on but again I throw 15:19 out to you and I'm a history major I studied history I think as much as 15:25 anybody has and without any reservation I've come to the conclusion in getting 15:31 to know mr. Trump that when I need somebody on my side to help us with 15:37 problems 15:39 he's the first man i want to choose and the first man I want to see and I think 15:44 if we vote for Donald Trump we are going to get started off in the next 15:49 presidency far away better than we could hope to be so i hope you folks will come 15:55 with me and walk that's a walk to walking and walk the step with Donald 16:01 Trump and let him take care of what the presidency is all about 16:06 thank you very much 16:10 ladies and gentlemen please welcome the next president of the United States mr. 16:18

17:42 back 17:43 we're gonna win it back 17:46 this is a movement and we're taking our country back for the people were taking 17:53 it back 17:53 it's been a long time as I travel the country the crowds get bigger and the 17:59 enthusiasm grows thousands of people outside they just left because I figure 18:04 we can't get in unless somebody wants would anybody like to give up their city 18:08 now I thought you were going to say that but there's so much love in the rooms 18:15 the Washington insiders they're panicking they are very concerned they 18:18 look at what's going on with the polls and they're saying what's happening 18:24 this wasn't supposed to happen it wasn't supposed to happen in the primaries and 18:29 this wasn't supposed to happen but it's happening and I think we're going to 18:32 bring it all the way we are going to replace our failed and corrupt 18:41 establishment with a new government that serves you your family the country 18:45 you're going to be happy the change is going to begin right away the key is 18:51 november eight if you can get in there a little early that's okay too 18:55 november eight my economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words 19:02 jobs jobs jobs we have to bring our jobs back on my first day in office i'm going 19:12 to order a review of every single regulation an executive order issued by 19:17 president obama 19:21 all job-killing regulations and all illegal executive orders will be 19:26 immediately terminated excessive regulation cost our economy two trillion 19:35 dollars here you believe that two trillion dollars year I want to put that 19:39 money back into the pockets of the American people where it belongs 19:45 i am going to direct the Department of Commerce to identify every single 19:50 violation of our trading rules by our foreign competitors who in many cases 19:56 sheet we will apply every lawful remedy to end these trade abuses once and for 20:04 all we have no choice we're going to end then trade will be fair and reciprocal 20:13 and products will be made in America and sold all around the world like we used 20:18 to do it you know when we were smart 20:22 we're going to pass one of the biggest and boldest tax reforms and tax 20:27 reductions in American history it's going to include a 15-percent tax rate 20:33 for all businesses small and large making our country a magnet for new jobs 20:38 that's fifteen percent down from thirty-five percent 20:44 income taxes will be cut dramatically for the workers of workers that I mean 20:50 the really hard workers 20:52 you're paying too much sex folks everybody knows it 20:55 so for the workers the middle class families everybody we're having a major 21:01 major tax reductions and i will tell you 21:04 Ivanka Trump wants childcare taken care of and we're going to do that okay 21:11 also on my first day i'm going to ask Congress to immediately send me a bill 21:17 to repeal and replace Obamacare 21:29 dreams in ohio have increased more than eighty percent since Obamacare was fast 21:35 eighty percent have you noticed it's not a pretty picture right 21:41 eighty percent premiums have gone up almost $5,000 nationwide since 2009 more 21:50 than two-thirds of our nation's counties and think of this have lost ensures 21:55 everyday i'm reading another one left all the big ones are all leaving its 21:59 falling anyway we're going to replace it and then terminated but even if we 22:03 didn't it's not making it just so you understand we're going to replace 22:08 government-run Obamacare with reforms that put patients first these reforms 22:17 include expanding access to popular healthcare savings accounts empowering 22:22 Americans to shop for their insurance so that they can really have great choice 22:27 right across state lines and to block granting and really important Medicaid 22:33 to the state so they can design innovative solutions to the best and 22:38 it's going to be solutions folks that best serve you your families your 22:44 children the whole thing best serve you 22:51 in addition to prosperity we will also provide safety we are going to take a 22:57 swift strong action to protect the American people from radical Islamic 23:03 terrorism 23:10 in recent days terrorists have attacked in new york city new jersey and 23:16 Minnesota and it's going to get worse it's going to get worse if Hillary as 23:22 president it would be a disaster if Trump is president you'll be very very 23:27 happy that now 23:40 not a pretty picture but if Trump is President you watch how good it will be 23:46 it will be a whole different story 23:49 these attacks like so many others were made possible because of our extremely 23:55 open immigration system it's time to put firm immigration controls in place 24:04 extreme wedding right extreme vetted to quote the bipartisan Commission 911 24:13 it is perhaps obvious to state that terrorists cannot plan and carry out 24:17 attacks in the united states if they are unable to enter our country 24:22 how about that that is why are my first day in office i will immediately suspend 24:28 the admission of Syrian refugees 24:35 President Obama wants to bring in another 110 thousand refugees next year 24:41 Hillary Clinton wants a five hundred and fifty percent increase over Obama's 24:47 numbers of Syrian refugees and we know nothing about the people 24:54 altogether the hillary clinton plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her 25:01 first turn her plan would cost 400 billion dollars in terms of lifetime 25:10 welfare and entitlement cause think of that not only the danger of it all 25:16 this isn't only a matter of terrorism but also a matter of quality of life we 25:22 want to make sure that we are only admitting those into our country who 25:25 support our values and love and I mean love our people 25:33 you polling shows that in many of our countries 25:41 yeah 25:43 yeah 25:48 by the way governor pence just commit for secondly I see him standing 25:55 backstage this was one of my really great decisions right here this guy is a 26:02 winner 26:11 great guy and a great family pew polling shows that in many of the conscious from 26:19 which we draw a large numbers of immigrants extreme views about religion 26:24 are commonplace for instance according to Pew a majority in afghanistan and 26:30 pakistan SE honor killings of women are often or sometimes justified a majority 26:38 of these countries also support the death penalty for those who leave the 26:42 faith we've admitted tens of thousands from these countries in the last few 26:48 years with no effective screening plan in place we have no we have no idea who 26:53 are letting in we have no idea what's happening in fact Hillary Clinton as 26:57 Secretary of State admitted multiple refugees who were later charged with 27:02 terrorism related activities bad ones 27:05 the State Department administers the refugee program Hillary had the chance 27:11 to put the needed protections in place and she didn't do it and now she's 27:16 running she's going to be so tough 27:18 she's gonna be so tough not gonna be tough not going to be tough 27:24 Hillary Clinton won't even say the words radical Islamic terrorism she won't say 27:30 the words Hillary Clinton she talks tough about my supporters that's what 27:35 she does but she doesn't want to talk about Islamic terrorists she calls the 27:41 patriotic Americans who support our campaign many of them cops and soldiers 27:46 deplorable and irredeemable 27:49 she won't use the same words to describe Islamic extremists who believe in the 27:57 oppression of women gays and people of different faiths but our people you you 28:03 I guess me probably me more than anybody 28:09 according to our but our people she has no problem with Hillary Clinton things 28:16 hard-working patriotic Americans like you are the problem 28:20 she doesn't get it and she doesn't understand how democracy works believe 28:25 me 28:26 public servers are just that they're there to serve you but the only people 28:32 Clinton has ever served are the special interests and her donors and I don't 28:38 know if you saw her campaign fifty-to-one and advertising 28:42 fifty-to-one and I think we're actually winning people over 50 to 1 28:52 our campaign is about breaking up the special-interest monopoly in Washington 28:57 DC 28:58 we're trying to disrupt thank you 29:01 we're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors the large 29:07 corporations and the media executives they're all part of the same political 29:12 establishment they go to the same restaurants they attend the same 29:18 conferences they have the same friends and connections they all support the 29:22 same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs your 29:28 factories in your wealth all the way out to other countries i am not running to 29:35 be president of the world i'm running to be President of the United States and 29:39 that's what we're going to do 29:48 we're gonna take care of our country Wow look at all the people up there it's a 29:54 big balcony 29:55 hello balcony 30:01 I am for America but specifically i am for America first it's going to be 30:07 America first hasn't happened in a long time together we will rebuild this 30:14 country beyond our greatest dreams that rebuilding begins with American 30:20 manufacturing ohio has lost one third of its manufacturing jobs since the bill 30:27 clinton signed NAFTA disaster which Hillary supported totally we're going to 30:35 renegotiate NAFTA to get a fair deal for our workers and it will be a fair deal 30:40 and if it's not will terminate and we'll start all over again because NAFTA is a 30:45 one-way Road out of our country for our jobs in our money 30:53 daft is devastated manufacturing right here in Ohio and Michigan and 30:59 Pennsylvania and all over New England and in the state of North Carolina where 31:04 I just left right now if Ford builds the current Ohio and exports it to Mexico 31:09 Mexico slaps us with a huge value added tax or a backdoor tariff but before it 31:16 moves its factories to Mexico and then exports a car back to America forgives 31:22 Ford and Mexico works this but mexico through the back will give forward a 31:27 hefty that tax rebate and backdoor export subsidy it makes it impossible 31:35 for our country to compete i don't know how many people just understood what I 31:40 said does anybody understand right because it makes it impossible they made 31:47 a mistake when they negotiated this deal we have different tax systems and Mexico 31:52 is I mean they got to be left in this going on for years 31:56 it makes it impossible for our country to compete 32:00 that's why how often you see the factors going the other way then we'll go the 32:04 other way they go so one way road out 32:07 not anymore folks believe 32:13 it's crazy it's crazy you look at that vat tax it's crazy they get it both ways 32:18 in other words they get it both ways and then we're afraid to tax the product 32:22 coming in okay and if we tax the product coming in guess what they wouldn't move 32:27 they wouldn't be leaving because now for does just announces moving all of its 32:31 small car production all of it to Mexico 32:38 where they're building among the biggest most sophisticated plants anywhere in 32:43 the world 32:43 not us Ohio has also lost more than 221,000 job since China joined the world 32:51 trade organization another deal pushed by bill clinton and supported by his 32:55 wife Hillary in November a we can finally close the history book on her 33:02 legacy of failure and turn the page to a bright and shining future 33:13 it will be a new dawn for the American worker starting in 2017 jobs are going 33:23 to start leaving other countries and coming back to us believe me believe 33:29 that includes apple products we are going to have an immigration system that 33:38 makes sense 33:39 one based on merit skill and promoting the economic interests of American 33:43 workers our tax code which now waste billions and billions of dollars a year 33:49 just in compliance will become simple streamlined and efficient and go way way 33:56 down we're taking those taxes way down way down your taxes are going away there 34:01 and Hillary Clinton i don't know if you know this because they don't talk about 34:06 it 34:06 Hillary Clinton is asking for a major tax increase remember that major 34:13 government will start working again fixing things we're going to have this 34:18 economy work again for you just look at my projects in New York white earned run 34:23 down spaces into new centers of business and we have hit such success taking 34:30 buildings that were failures and made them successful made them incredible 34:34 buildings jobs so many things even an ice-skating rink took eight years the 34:40 city couldn't build it I did it in three months okay you know 34:48 where others only saw problems i saw potential we turned empty lots and empty 34:54 buildings and empty homes into living memories of thousands of workers and 34:58 their families hired thousands and thousands of people and they've done a 35:02 great job for me i can tell you that that's what I want to do for our country 35:06 I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods to failing schools the 35:10 Forgotten stretches of this nation of which there are many and unlock their 35:15 potential for all of our people i made a living for years looking for unused 35:25 spaces and imagining what could be politicians look at blighted 35:31 neighborhoods and offer only excuses they look for one thing they look for 35:38 the votes of people living in the inner cities and then they say we'll see you 35:42 later in four years after the election takes place i look at the same 35:48 neighborhoods and i want to offer solutions and I have offered solutions 35:52 and all you have to do is look at what's happening with the poll numbers with 35:57 african-americans and with Hispanics they are really going up big league 36:03 because they get it 36:07 we spent so much time thinking about how things used to be 36:11 we've stopped thinking about how great things could be all we have to do is 36:16 turn out the doubters the cynics and the naysayers of which we have a lot of them 36:21 and I understand why we have so many because they haven't seen it's been all 36:27 talk no action for so many years by politicians but just remember this 36:31 I'm not a politician thankfully I'm not 36:39 we are a nation of strivers dreamers and believers and that's the spirit that we 36:44 will carry right into November november eight to be specific and we are going to 36:50 have a great great monumental victory it's going to be an amazing day for this 36:56 country 37:00 I don't know if you know it look at crowds like this every auditory of every 37:04 place is sold out thousands of people outside always what we have is a 37:09 movement like they've never seen before they've never seen it many of the 37:12 commentators bill o'reilly many of the commentators said it's one of the great 37:17 political phenomenas of our time but you know what 37:21 to me it's only a phenomena if we win in november eighth otherwise it's not a 37:27 phenomenon we gotta get some of that Bobby Knight stuff in us right 37:34 he won he knew how to win that's for sure 37:38 it's that same spirit of resilience i have seen visiting the flood-ravaged 37:45 towns of Louisiana where Hillary Clinton refused to go or meeting the incredible 37:51 but hard hit people in cities and towns like flint michigan where I just left 37:56 recently that was a rough site to look at flint michigan it's that spirit of 38:02 strength we need to start winning again as a country in this effort no part of 38:09 our country will be left behind when any part of our country hurts 38:14 we all heard 38:19 nationwide nearly four in ten african-american children live in 38:25 poverty including forty-five percent of african-american children under the age 38:30 of six can you believe that 45% we should never accept this level of 38:37 poverty in our country and there is no greater anti-poverty program in the 38:42 world then weíll good jobs but to unlock jobs we must also make 38:53 communities safe crime is rising across this country more than 3,000 people have 38:59 been shot in Chicago since january of this year to the african-american 39:05 community
