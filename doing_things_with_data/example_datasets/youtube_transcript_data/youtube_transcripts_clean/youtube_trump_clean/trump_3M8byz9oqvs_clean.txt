10:04 and we are going to win back the White 10:09 House 10:11 real change begins with immediately 10:15 immediately repealing and replacing 10:18 Obamacare it's just been announced that 10:25 the residents of North Carolina are 10:27 going to experience massive double-digit 10:30 premium hikes so high and I say this to 10:35 all the groups because it's also high 10:36 it's so depressing I don't want to tell 10:38 him what it is so i won't tell you 10:40 because right now you're happy and you 10:42 be very said you probably turn your head 10:44 down and start leaving but it's bad in 10:48 the great state of Arizona as an example 10:50 premiums are going up more than one 10:53 hundred and sixteen percent 95 of 100 10:59 north carolina counties will only have 11:02 one insurance in the obamacare exchange 11:05 next year lots of luck with that 11:06 dissociation premiums are searching 11:10 companies are leaving insurers are 11:12 fleeing doctors are quitting and 11:14 deductibles are going through the roof 11:17 yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down 11:21 and Obamacare making it even more 11:23 expensive and in fact much more 11:26 expensive i'm asking you for your vote 11:28 so we can repeal and replace Obamacare 11:31 and save healthcare not only for North 11:34 Carolina but for the country some s real 11:38 change also means restoring honesty to 11:42 government as you know the FBI has 11:45 reopened its criminal investigation of 11:49 Hillary 11:55 Oh 12:10 they're also conducting a second 12:13 criminal investigation into Hillary's 12:15 pay-for-play corruption at the State 12:17 Department it has just been confirmed 12:22 that the 650,000 emails they discovered 12:26 that were turned in by the way they 12:28 discovered them thank you to mr. anthony 12:33 weiner 12:38 include brand new emails not previously 12:41 turned over to authorities likely 12:44 including even more classified 12:47 information and may be classified at the 12:51 highest highest level how said however 12:55 the reports also show that the political 12:57 leadership at the Department of Justice 12:59 is trying very hard as hard as they can 13:04 to protect Hillary Clinton think of it I 13:09 think of it you have a great four star 13:12 general that right now 13:14 current a current four-star general that 13:17 right now 13:18 general Cartwright james Cartwright is 13:22 possibly going to be serving as much as 13:24 five years in jail 13:26 General Petraeus great general his life 13:30 was destroyed young man took some 13:32 pictures of a separate he's in jail now 13:34 for a year I watched his mother the 13:36 other night and Hillary Clinton's 13:39 running for president and she's done 25 13:41 times worse than any of them or all of 13:44 them put together 13:48 John Podesta her boss her head said that 13:53 she has been instance pretty bad when 13:56 your person your top person working for 13:58 you said yet bad instincts that came out 14:01 on Wikileaks Bernie Sanders would say 14:03 constantly during the debates which by 14:06 the way she received the questions 14:09 nobody ever says anything about can you 14:11 imagine if i received the questions to 14:15 the debates they would call for my 14:18 immediate withdrawal you don't even hear 14:21 about it from her 14:23 you don't even hear about it but Bernie 14:25 centers such as bad bad judgment she 14:29 does just take a look at what she's done 14:31 take a look at the email mess how about 14:33 if she's running the country can't even 14:35 run an email 14:36 Hillary created an illegal email service 14:39 shields or criminal activity and then 14:41 she illegally destroy 33,000 emails 14:46 after receiving a congressional subpoena 14:50 I mean think of that she made 13 phones 14:55 disappear somewhere the hammer 14:58 she is the most corrupt person ever to 15:01 seek the office of the presidency 15:06 if you were when it would created 15:09 unprecedented constitutional crisis if 15:14 she ever got into the Oval Office 15:16 Hillary under special interests would 15:17 rob this country blind you've seen 15:20 what's happened 15:22 the Clinton family have made themselves 15:24 rich by being in politics as President 15:29 Harry Truman once said you can't get 15:33 rich in politics unless you're a truck 15:36 which is an interesting exciting Eric's 15:39 room my contract with the American voter 15:43 begins with a plan to end government 15:46 corruption and you take our country back 15:48 from the special interests and you know 15:54 I used to be on the other side of things 15:56 in case you didn't know and I let a very 15:59 nice life but i also love our country 16:02 and this was an easy decision i went 16:05 from being the ultimate insider to being 16:09 an outsider like they've never seen 16:10 before we are doing so well this is a 16:12 movement like that never ever seen 16:16 before 16:17 I've never seen anything like this 16:20 before i love this country 16:23 I want the entire corrupt Washington 16:25 establishment to hear the words we are 16:29 about to see when we went in november 16:32 eight we are going to Washington and we 16:35 will drain the swamp social 16:41 so true and expressing I've gotten to 16:43 like at the core of my contract is my 16:46 plan to bring back our jobs 16:50 North Carolina has lost nearly half of 16:54 its manufacturing jobs and after a deal 16:57 signed by bill clinton and supported by 17:00 crooked Hillary Clinton America is lost 17:04 70,000 factory since China entered the 17:08 World Trade Organization another bill 17:10 and hillary backed disaster 17:13 we're living through the greatest jobs 17:16 theft in the history of the world nobody 17:19 has ever taken jobs from anyone like 17:23 other countries have taken our jobs 17:25 thank you i love you too rough guy he's 17:29 a rough sanding guy but i do love him I 17:33 do love them I love you all 17:36 I guess that's why I'm doing this I 17:38 guess 17:41 I guess bill o tex laid off 1125 workers 17:49 and move their jobs to Mexico and other 17:52 countries freightliner later 500 workers 17:56 in mount holly and move their jobs to 17:58 Mexico brunswick corporation laid off 18:02 212 workers and move their jobs to 18:05 Mexico flextronics I'm not gonna buy 18:09 their product anymore let it off 312 18:12 work in charlotte and move their jobs to 18:15 Mexico China and various other countries 18:18 and many many more we could go on all 18:20 day long with a trump administration 18:23 will stop the jobs of leaving America 18:26 and we will stop the jobs from leaving 18:29 North Carolina that i can tell you the 18:34 theft of American prosperity will end 18:37 and it will end immediately upon taking 18:39 office if a company wants to fire their 18:43 workers leave North Carolina moved to 18:45 another country and then ship their 18:48 products back into the United States we 18:52 will make them pay a tax of thirty-five 18:55 percent 18:57 and I'll tell you what's gonna happen 19:00 they're not leaving they're not gonna 19:02 leave and for the ones that do that's 19:04 okay we'll make a fortune when they sell 19:06 their products into the schedule but 19:08 they won't be leaving North Carolina it 19:11 in so quickly now the politicians 19:13 probably knew this i'm sure you've never 19:15 heard it before 19:16 probably have it but you'll stop it 19:19 immediately the outflow jobs from our 19:21 country is disgraceful to disgrace a 19:25 trump administration will renegotiate 19:27 after and if we don't get the deal we 19:30 want we will terminate NAFTA and get a 19:33 much better deal for our companies and 19:36 our workers we will also immediately 19:41 stop the job-killing trans-pacific 19:44 partnership with Hillary Clinton loved 19:47 and said it's the gold standard it is 19:50 the gold standard for other countries 19:52 not for us 19:54 that'll take the rest of our jobs as 19:56 part of our plan to bring back jobs we 19:58 are going to show and create lower taxes 20:03 on American business from thirty-five 20:05 percent down to fifteen percent it will 20:10 start the engine running like you've 20:12 never seen 20:13 we will massively cut taxes for the 20:17 middle class and hillary wants to 20:18 increase your taxes by a lot so between 20:21 Obamacare which will double and double 20:23 and double and higher taxes you're not 20:27 going to be happy if you have Hillary 20:29 Clinton we will unleash the American 20:33 energy and I tell you we have

23:45 and yes we will build a great wall 24:02 we've received the first-ever endorser 24:04 issued by America's incredible people 24:08 the border patrol officers and ice never 24:11 given an endorsement before it's just 24:15 been reported that as a result of our 24:16 open borders violent cartels have spread 24:20 into all 50 of our state's more than 24:23 ninety percent of those arrested are 24:26 illegals they're here illegally think of 24:30 it ninety percent are here illegally you 24:33 ask yourself what are we doing what are 24:35 we doing 24:36 they're killing innocent Americans 24:38 threatening and they are just killing 24:40 innocent Americans take a look at what's 24:43 happening threatening schools and 24:45 destroying communities a government that 24:48 will not protect its people as a 24:50 government that is unworthy to lead and 24:53 unworthy to serve as Secretary of State 24:58 Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the 25:01 most dangerous and violent criminal 25:03 aliens to go free because their home 25:05 countries were very smart they wouldn't 25:08 take them back 25:09 we bring their way to get out of here 25:12 murderers drug lords gang heads would 25:17 bring their they say we don't want her 25:18 back 25:19 we don't want him back well let me tell 25:21 you something 25:22 there won't be one instance in four 25:24 years or eight years where we bring them 25:27 into their country that they come back 25:29 and our country that I can promise they 25:32 came back all the time they said we 25:34 don't want to miss you would say oh 25:36

support sanctuary cities like in san 25:48 francisco where Kate Steinle was 25:51 murdered by an illegal immigrant 25:53 deported at least five times thousands 25:57 of Americans would be alive today if it 26:00 were not for the open border policy of 26:04 obama and clinton here in North Carolina 26:07 20-year old Liana known and a run born 26:10 child were killed by the 26:12 the limit with two

that knew him back to have him 26:32 incarcerated or deported but they 26:37 wouldn't do it another amazing American 26:40 lost his life to illegal immigration was 26:42 John Wilkerson whose mother I've gotten 26:45 to know during the campaign Josh a 26:48 student in high school was murdered at 26:51 the age of 17 credible young man great 26:54 student great person everybody loved him 26:57 he

27:34 every last criminal Alien and dismantle 27:37 every criminal gang in cartel 27:40 threatening our citizens and that'll 27:42 happen very quickly 27:45 when we win you'll finally have a 27:48 government on your side fighting your 27:51 community and protecting your family 27:58 we will also repeal the obama-clinton 28:01 defense requests and rebuild our badly 28:05 depleted military we have great people 28:08 we have great great people North 28:12 Carolina will be at the very center of 28:13 this effort with new advanced fighters 28:16 flying from seymour johnson air force 28:18 base we will have the newest and the 28:20 best not the old stuff that's 18 and 20 28:24 years old where they don't even make 28:26 parts anymore 28:27 we will have the newest and the best and 28:30 marine battalions at Camp Lejeune I know 28:33 capitalism world we're going to be 28:38 increasing the numbers and did we ever 28:40 need it more 28:41 yeah there were times when we needed it 28:43 badly but we're right at the top right 28:46 now we need our great military will have 28:52 made your new investments also made to 28:55 Fort Bragg anybody from Fort Bragg so we 28:58 were there the other night we have 29:00 23,000 people it was a damn it was 29:02 anybody there that was an amazing 29:04 evening 29:05 that was an incredible evening we had 29:08 generals we had Admirals we had 29:10 recipients of the medal of honor that 29:13 was an incredible evening and some of 29:15 the people who have given us the 29:18 endorsement we have over 200 Admirals 29:20 and Generals we have 22 medal of honor 29:23 recipients who have totally endorse me 29:26 in the numbers increasing on a daily 29:27 basis they like our thought process like 29:31 when we go into muscle that we do it 29:34 quietly that we don't announce it for 29:37 months in advance 29:38 we're going into most so in four months 29:43 why do they have to say that why do they 29:46 have to say that and you see the 29:48 resistance is now very set we're going 29:51 in because we 29:53 Isis leaders are staying there and we 29:56 are going to get them three months 30:00 we're going into most so two months 30:02 we're going into months one month one 30:05 week 30:06 well let me tell you they left the first 30:10 time they heard it they were gone and 30:13 it's being very very tough human shields 30:15 of being used all sorts of booby traps 30:18 of being set 30:20 why can't we go with surprise right 30:26 remembered i mean in high school it's 30:29 called the element of surprise 30:31 General Douglas we got their general 30:34 george patton can you imagine what they 30:36 would be thinking if they saw this 30:38 stupidity this stupidity of our 30:40 leadership and we have a leader only 30:43 does campaigns for cook I've been all 30:45 he's doing is campaigning for crooked 30:48 Hillary that's only wants that 30:51 and you know she can't get any crabs and 30:54 she doesn't have what it takes to do 30:57 rallies all over the place she wants to 31:00 go home and go to sleep so she's got 31:02 biting he challenged me he challenged me 31:07 oh I'd like to take him i'd like to take 31:10 him behind the gym all our i dream of 31:14 that I dream 31:15 let me just tell you hey folks let me 31:18 just tell you if I ever said that if I 31:22 ever said that they thought it was so 31:24 cute all was there wonderful what our 31:27 vice president said if I ever said that 31:30 always a bully he's a horrible person he 31:33 challenged our Vice President to a fight 31:36 can you imagine what a bully is much 31:40 smarter much better education much 31:43 everything I mean give me a break 31:46 they have Biden going around they have 31:48 all these people and then when they 31:50 can't when that doesn't work because you 31:52 know Obama is going wherever I go I see 31:55 Air Force One and who's paying for air 31:59 force one there as he travels to 32:02 campaign but wherever I go and I see him 32:05 screaming at people that are protesters 32:08 and with me they show the protest with 32:10 him they just kept the camera they 32:12 didn't want to show the protest but i'll 32:15 tell you what he should not be 32:17 campaigning for Hillary Clinton he 32:20 should be in the oval office working on 32:22 jobs working on building up our military 32:24 working on good trade deals and you know 32:29 the press which is the world's most 32:31 dishonest people these people they never 32:34 show these traps they never show the 32:36 crowds never ever 32:41 they never show the crowds but you know 32:45 the press and I must tell you one of the 32:47 things I've learned is depressed is I 32:52 mean honestly they're among the most 32:53 dishonest people I've ever met in my 32:55 life
