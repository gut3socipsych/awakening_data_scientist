so-called choice that 2:35 was my first higher as we would say in 2:38 Las Vegas and and i'll tell you the good 2:42 when he was phenomenal he was cool he 2:45 was smart he was 2:47 I mean you just take a look at him he 2:49 was meant to be doing what he's doing 2:51 and we are very very proud of Governor 2:54 Mike pets 2:56 thank you Mike Pence I'd argue that Mike 3:02 had the single most decisive victory in 3:06 the history of vice presidential debates 3:08 I believe that 3:09 and last night America also got to look 3:14 first hand at my judgment and that was 3:17 judgment you know you need judgment for 3:19 people for deals we don't do deals like 3:22 the Iran deal we don't do deals like 3:24 that anymore false we don't do deals 3:27 like that 1.7 billion in cash and we're 3:31 in Las Vegas when you hear 1.7 billion i 3:34 think this whole stage would be filled 3:36 up to the roof 3:37 whoever heard of things like what's 3:40 going on 3:41 unbelievable well Mike laid out big and 3:44 bold solutions for America his opponent 3:47 talked only of small and petty 3:50 distractions 3:53 Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 3:56 years and hasn't fixed anything she goes 4:02 around will do this will do that will do 4:05 this all these things it's all wonderful 4:07 the problem is why didn't she doing in 4:11 fact she's just made things worse she 4:14 failed in upstate New York is a senator 4:16 promising to create in order to get 4:19 elected 200,000 jobs but manufacturing 4:23 is down more than forty percent and the 4:26 jobs have left is just the opposite 4:29 she failed overseas producing only death 4:32 and destruction she Unleashed Isis 4:36 destabilized Iraq Syria Libya and 4:41 putting ran onto the path of nuclear 4:44 weapons in less than 10 years now they 4:47 will have nuclear weapons one of the 4:48 dumbest deals ever made whether it's 4:54 countries or any kind of a deal you can 4:57 think of one of the dumbest steals ever 5:00 made at home Hilary Clinton failed 5:03 Latinos and african-americans producing 5:06 only more poverty in there ended in the 5:09 inner cities and you see that you see 5:10 that all wherever you go to the inner 5:12 cities nothing happens 5:15 it never happens it's called give me 5:17 about and then they don't come back four 5:21 years later they come back she's merely 5:23 the vessel for the global 5:26 special-interest bleeding our country 5:28 dry they are bleeding our country 5:31 I'm running to represent Americans and 5:35 we are going to make America rich again 5:40 we're not rich where debtor nation right 5:43 there i'm going to end illegal 5:48 immigration 5:53 stop the massive inflow of refugees keep 5:57 jobs from pouring out of our country 5:59 renegotiate are totally disastrous trade 6:03 deals and massively reduced taxes and 6:07 regulations or our workers and our 6:10 businesses 6:14 my economic agenda will be very very 6:17 simple it's called jobs jobs jobs 6:27 our jobs are all leaving the problems we 6:31 face as a country are immense and it's 6:33 going to take bold action to turn things 6:36 around 6:38 we need to change we need change right 6:42 now we owe 20 trillion dollars debt 20 6:48 trillion dollars it doubled under 6:52 President Obama our infrastructure is 6:57 like that of a third world country the 7:00 homicide rate last year experience the 7:04 biggest single year increase in more 7:07 than 45 years is anybody know that 7:09 biggest increase in homicide in 45 years 7:13 our police are underfunded understaffed 7:17 and under supported and Hillary Clinton 7:20 basically accuses our police of all 7:24 being racist 7:27 our border is wide open and drugs and 7:33 criminal cartels are pouring into our 7:36 country on an hourly basis thousands of 7:42 refugees are being admitted with no way 7:45 to screen them and are instantly made 7:48 eligible for welfare and free health 7:50 care even as our own veterans are great 7:54 great veterans died while they're 7:56 waiting on line for medical care that 8:00 they desperately need our veterans will 8:07 be taken care of like they've never been 8:09 taken care of before 8:18 do we have some veterans in the group 8:20 standout stand-up veterans 8:26 Wow 8:35 we have such tremendous support from the 8:37 veterans group from law enforcement 8:40 veterans groups from all over the 8:42 country we just had the environment from 8:45 the Fraternal Order of Police which 8:47 represents massive amounts of police 8:51 almost every Police group almost every 8:54 veteran group and then I saw today I 8:57 left the room and I saw a commercial 8:59 where it was really a nasty commercial 9:02 totally made up about me with vets there 9:06 is nobody that loves the vets more or 9:08 respects the vets more they're spending 9:10 hundreds of millions of dollars on false 9:13 commercials and it's a disgrace 9:15 so what we'll do i guess we'll assume 9:17 let's assume right let's go from 9:20 believable 9:24 they say let's see where struck doing 9:27 well he's doing well with the vet so 9:29 let's do a commercial on the that's and 9:31 whatever is unpopular they'll just put 9:33 it in let me tell you we're gonna take 9:35 care of our vets like you've never been 9:37 taken care of before remember them our 9:42 annual trade deficit with the world is 9:46 nearly listen to this 800 billion 9:49 dollars a year ago she ending our deals 9:52 right we have political hacks 9:55 negotiating ideals and we have the 9:59 greatest business people in the world in 10:01 our country why aren't we using them 800 10:04 billion dollars a year in trade the 10:08 federal budget is a total disaster our 10:11 state Department mostly under the watch 10:13 of crooked Hillary Clinton misplaced or 10:16 lost six billion dollars in can you 10:21 imagine this they lost you know you lose 10:24 a couple of bucks they lost six billion 10:27 dollars in taxpayer funds 10:31 we have the worst so-called recovery by 10:36 far since the Great Depression were a 10:39 nation totally divided with race riots 10:43 in the streets are college students 10:45 graduate loaded with debt only to 10:48 discover they can't find jobs or 10:51 certainly not the jobs they want or not 10:54 the jobs they were trained for and 10:56 worked so hard to get those jobs have 10:59 left our allies aren't paying their fair 11:02 share 11:03 foreign countries like Russia and China 11:06 do not respect us ever see Hillary 11:09 Clinton when she wants to talk tough 11:10 about Putin they say Donald Trump loves 11:15 food 11:16 I don't love I don't hate 11:21 we'll see how it works we'll see maybe 11:25 we'll have a good relationship maybe 11:27 we'll have a horrible relationship maybe 11:30 we'll have a relationship right in the 11:32 middle 11:33 I can't say this and we got along with 11:36 Russia and Russia one out with us and 11:40 knock the hell out of Isis that's ok 11:42 with me folks that's okay with me 11:49 so our taxpayers and knots all of us as 11:52 citizens are sending troops and foreign 11:54 aid all over the world even as their own 11:57 cities can't provide the most basic 12:01 services we go to some of these middle 12:05 eastern locations and we'll build a 12:07 school and they blow it up and we build 12:09 it again and they blow it up but when we 12:11 want to school here are in Brooklyn New 12:14 York or in Los Angeles or someplace else 12:17 we don't have the funds we spent six 12:21 trillion dollars in the Middle East 12:23 think of that we could have rebuilt our 12:25 country twice if we knew what the hell 12:28 we were doing and we're not respected at 12:35 all 12:36 America needs a turnaround America needs 12:39 a comeback 12:41 America needs a change and that's why 12:44 I'm running 13:01 ok 13:05 I november eight we're going to show the 13:08 whole world that America is back bigger 13:11 and better and stronger than ever ever 13:15 ever before 13:17 stronger than ever before 13:21 first we're going to repeal and replace 13:25 the disaster known as Obamacare 13:35 President Obama said if you like your 13:37 doctor you can keep your doctor that was 13:41 alive he promised his plan would reduce 13:45 premiums by two thousand five hundred 13:47 dollars for person that was a lie 13:51 instead they surged too much more than 13:54 five thousand dollars and you know it 13:57 because you're all here 13:58 you're all witness now it happens 14:02 yesterday right 14:04 Bill Clinton yesterday oh they're so 14:08 angry Adam they scolded him yesterday he 14:13 was scolded did everybody hear what 14:17 happened yesterday and this is what I've 14:21 been saying for years so bill clinton 14:26 torched President Obama's signature 14:30 legislation remember Hillary Clinton 14:36 called Obamacare one of the greatest 14:39 accomplishments of President Obama of 14:43 the Democratic Party and of our country 14:46 itself right but bill had a different 14:49 view 14:50 he said it's just a crazy system and 14:56 that's the way he said it 14:58 it's that craziest thing in the whole 15:01 world then he went on to say well I want 15:05 people out there are busting it true 15:08 they're working like out there busting 15:11 it sometimes 60 hours a week and wind up 15:17 with their premiums doubled and their 15:20 coverage cut and a half this is Bill 15:22 Clinton to people getting killed he said 15:26 in this deal and small business people 15:30 and individuals who make just a bit too 15:34 much money 15:35 to get these subsidies you know what 15:37 happens they don't get anything to get 15:40 nothing 15:42 Clinton added it doesn't make any sense 15:46 insurance model just doesn't work so you 15:54 know they're always telling me oh you 15:59 say such just apologize aah just 16:02 apologize i think that President Obama 16:05 should apologize for obamacare 16:16 and I think that Hillary Clinton should 16:20 apologize for pursuing Obamacare and she 16:25 wants to make it even worse than it is 16:28 right now we're going to repeal it and 16:30 we're gonna replace it with much less 16:33 expensive and much better care and this 16:39 is essential for your great state and 16:41 migrate state because Obamacare the 16:45 majority of the counties in your state 16:49 have only one insurers to choose from 16:53 did you read that this morning in your 16:55 good paper paper owned by a great guy 16:58 Sheldon Sheldon Sheldon Adelson and a 17:03 great supporter of Israel sheldon 17:05 adelson great support 17:10 there's only one way to stop Obamacare 17:15 vote for Donald J Trump very simple very 17:21 simple 17:26 as a very simple way to do it you gotta 17:30 get out there November a I say kiddingly 17:34 but I mean it i don't care how sick you 17:38 are i don't care if you just came back 17:43 from the doctor and he gave you the 17:47 worst possible prognosis meaning it's 17:52 over 17:53 you won't be around in two weeks doesn't 17:56 matter 17:57 hang out til November a get out and vote 18:03 and then all we're going to say is we 18:07 love you and we will remember you always 18:09 get out involved and don't let the other 18:17 side take this election away from us 18:19 because this is the last chance we get 18:22 and I see Elvis back there Elvis this is 18:27 the last chance we get the deadline to 18:32 register to vote is october eight in you 18:37 stay so you could do that early this way 18:39 you don't have to wait around til 18:42 november eight if you're the person 18:43 seeing the doctor right now we have all 18:46 great healthy people you have to be 18:48 healthy because Obamacare does it works 18:50 you have that you really have no choice 18:53 that's the only thing good about 18:55 obamacare is you have to maintain your 18:57 help 18:58 which is good psychologically to think 19:00 that way because obamacare will not be 19:03 there it's a disaster 19:05 early voting begins on the twenty-second 19:08 fixing our trade deals will be the 19:11 foundation of our economic revival China 19:15 Japan and Europe are printing huge sums 19:19 of money the devaluation of currencies 19:23 is staggering as to what it represents 19:25 to our country our businesses our 19:28 citizens and our jobs every time we 19:31 start making progress 19:32 china devalued its currency and we go 19:35 right back to the drawing board 19:36 because you can't compete against that 19:38 it's cheating 19:40 we're not on a level playing field and 19:42 our politicians don't understand what's 19:46 going on they really don't get it and 19:48 the ones that do get it are taken care 19:50 of with political contributions so they 19:53 close their eyes 19:54 we're going to do something much 19:56 different and I'm spending my own money 19:57 on my campaign i'll tell ya I'm spending 20:00 a fortune one of the very big pundits 20:07 will very respected actually very 20:11 liberal said you know what you've done 20:15 has never been done before and it makes 20:18 no difference if you win or lose this 20:19 movement that will go down in history 20:21 I said no you don't understand I'd like 20:24 to agree with you but if I don't win 20:26 this will be the greatest waste of time 20:29 money and energy in my lifetime by a 20:33 factor of a hundred because if we don't 20:36 win we can change things we can't bring 20:39 back common sense we can strengthen our 20:42 military which is so depleted we can't 20:45 save our Second Amendment so many 20:46 different things so we have to win we 20:49 have to win our jobs are being lost in 20:54 massive numbers and we're not making 20:57 things relatively speaking in America 21:01 anymore too much is being made in other 21:05 countries when I president we will start 21:08 making things in America again 21:14 our nation has lost one third of its 21:18 manufacturing jobs since bill clinton 21:20 signed after you know it's clinton that 21:23 signed a lot of people don't know that 21:24 one of the worst trade deals in the 21:26 history of the world 21:29 the deal was also supported very 21:32 strongly by Hillary Clinton Hillary's 21:36 Korea deal 21:37 south korea cost us another hundred 21:41 thousand jobs remember that was supposed 21:43 to be a good deal 21:44 it cost us jobs tremendous numbers of 21:46 jobs and South Korea like almost every 21:49 other country is laughing at how stupid 21:51 we are 21:52 since China entered the World Trade 21:55 Organization another bill and hillary 21:58 back deal 70,000 factors when I saw 22:04 70,000 said please go back it can't be 22:06 possible 22:07 can't keep I think it maybe 700 7070 22:14 thousand factors have shut down or left 22:17 the United States can you believe this 22:20 70,000 that's 15 factory's closing a day 22:25 on average we are living through the 22:29 greatest job theft in the history of the 22:33 world our jobs are being stolen by 22:37 countries with much smarter leadership 22:40 than ours 22:42 not gonna happen anymore folks not gonna 22:45 happen anymore 22:48 as the factories leave our money leaves 22:53 with them 22:55 stores closed school suffer the tax face 22:58 arose wages fall and the quality of life 23:02 totally declines real cash wages for 23:06 many workers today are lower than they 23:09 were in 1973 i usually say 18 years but 23:17 it goes back much further people think 23:20 of this people are working harder today 23:23 they have sometimes two or three jobs 23:26 then they were I'll just stay with the 23:28 18 this is 1973 18 years so they made 23:33 more money eighteen years ago they may 23:35 take the younger they are less 23:38 experienced today they work harder 23:41 they're older and they make less money 23:43 now the only thing i can say to make you 23:46 feel better is I'm also older and I'm 23:50 also working the hardest I've ever 23:52 worked in my life doing this is the 23:54 hardest I've ever work in my own true 23:58 that's true 24:00 this is work although it's like love but 24:03 it's work but we're getting there were 24:06 going to make America great again it's 24:08 going to be worth it okay 24:11 we rebuilt other countries at the 24:16 expense of our own skyscrapers going up 24:19 in Beijing while plants and factories 24:22 crumble and the United States companies 24:26 like carrier General Electric motorola 24:30 mattel fiat-chrysler and so many others 24:33 I could go by the hundreds are moving 24:36 their jobs to Mexico and other countries 24:39 and now four dozen ounce two weeks ago 24:43 it's moving all of its small car 24:45 production to Mexico on top of the 24:47 massive plant that they announced three 24:50 years ago 24:52 that's going to cost $MONEY to $MONEY 24:53 billion dollars that's now complete and 24:57 then you wonder why we're doing well in 24:59 Michigan and Ohio because I've been 25:01 saying this for five years I have been 25:03 saying this for the last two weeks like 25:05 Hillary who doesn't know what's 25:07 happening 25:07 I've been saying this for five years and 25:10 the people of Michigan know that and the 25:13 people of Ohio know that and that's why 25:16 we're way up in Ohio and that's why 25:20 we're doing so well in Michigan a state 25:22 that normally a Republican wouldn't do 25:24 that well but they're losing all their 25:26 jobs to Mexico and other places we're 25:30 going to really go well you ready for 25:33 this one Fox we're going to renegotiate 25:35 NAFTA 25:38 and if we don't get the deal we want we 25:41 will withdraw from NAFTA and start all 25:44 over again making better deals for our 25:47 workers it's going to be America first 25:51 is America first 25:53 no more like let's take care of 25:55 everybody else except ourselves 26:17 we're also going to stand up to foreign 26:22 currency manipulation and apply tariffs 26:26 and taxes to the countries that sheet 26:29 that way we neutralize that way our 26:33 businesses can compete and we won't lose 26:36 our jobs we will also stop the 26:41 trans-pacific partnership the deal she 26:44 called the gold standard Hillary Clinton 26:47 said and then during the debate she lied 26:49 and she said I never said that and then 26:53 they actually fact checked her and they 26:55 said Trump was right finally I'm right 26:57 fine 27:02 every time I made a statement this 27:04 character challenge me she can say 27:06 whatever she want say you're going to 27:09 check that seven so they check the 27:11 statement she called it the goal-setting 27:13 let me tell you DP will be almost as bad 27:16 as mine after nothing's like NAFTA but 27:19 it'll take your jobs out of your state 27:21 it will take them out of Ohio and 27:23 Michigan and Pennsylvania TPP is a 27:27 disaster and they don't cover currency 27:30 manipulation because our politicians 27:32 didn't want to put the necessary 27:35 language into the documents and the 27:37 documents are over 5,000 pages long and 27:40 nobody from our country practically has 27:43 even read them 27:44 don't let it happen and if I win forget 27:48 it and we're gonna have trained but 27:51 instead of having trade deals with all 27:52 of these different countries that so 27:55 complicated will do trade one-on-one 27:58 1111 and if they don't treat us right we 28:02 send him a letter of default and by the 28:05 time that letter of default and now you 28:07 can't do that because you've got to go 28:09 through all this looks like a jigsaw 28:11 puzzle the backers of the TPP have 28:14 donated heavily to Hillary Clinton and 28:17 their wishes her command 28:18 she's an insider fighting only for 28:21 herself and for her donors I'm an 28:24 outsider fighting for you that's what 28:26 I'm doing this 28:34 we will stop the foreign cheating the 28:39 product dumping and the one-sided trade 28:43 deals this stuff will not happen anymore 28:46 folks we're not going to have a country 28:51 left with lower taxes on American 28:54 businesses from 35% to fifteen percent 28:58 and many small businesses will file as 29:01 individuals and pay only twelve percent 29:05 a massive tax cuts 29:10 on top of that we will have the largest 29:13 regulatory reform in American history 29:17 our regulations are a disaster 29:20 they're putting businesses out of 29:22 business are tax trade energy and 29:25 regulatory reforms will help us reach 29:28 four percent growth and create at least 29:30 25 million new jobs within a decade 29:34 America will become the great jobs 29:39 magnet of the world and i will be the 29:47 greatest jobs president that God ever 29:49 created I tell you that that will happen 29:52 that will have 29:56 factories will come rushing in our 29:59 schools and communities will be 30:01 revitalized and our poorest citizens 30:03 will get new jobs and higher pay and new 30:08 hope for their life but to be rich 30:12 station we must also be a security shin 30:16 security begins at the border you 30:20 understand any government that does not 30:25 protect its own people is a government 30:28 unworthy and unfit to leave countless 30:35 Americans who have died in recent years 30:38 would be alive today if not for the open 30:42 border policies of Hillary Clinton and 30:46 Barack Obama this includes incredible

committed crimes you wouldn't believe it 39:33 but who have escaped the law entirely 39:37 when I'm president we are getting them 39:39 out of our country and we're getting 39:41 them out immediately quickly Fath 39:47 and a lot of the country's from where 39:49 they came won't take them back they 39:52 don't want to back their killers they're 39:54 this there that we don't want to back 39:56 and

gladly gladly ok planted they don't want 40:16 to take him back so they're on our 40:18 streets killing people all Americans 40:22 living lovely in this country including 40:25 millions of wonderful patriotic 40:28 hard-working immigrants are entitled to 40:30 have their jobs and wages and their 40:33 security totally protected the borders 40:36 around our nation are for the benefit of 40:39 all people living here today everybody 40:41 and those borders are erased 40:45 it's often done by the lawful immigrants 40:49 already here and if you look at what's 40:52 going on with the borders and very 40:55 simply if they are erased and if we have 40:58 no borders we really have no country and 41:02 that's really what's happened and i have 41:04 to tell you I've been endorsed by the 41:07 Border Patrol agent 16,500 by ice two 41:13 days ago ice first time they've ever 41:16 endorsed anybody for president I was 41:21 endorsed by Sheriff Joe Joe Joe knows 41:24 the border 41:25 he knows the board we love sheriff joe 41:29 at the same time our country is being 41:35 infiltrated by terrorists just two days 41:38 ago an immigrant from Bangladesh was 41:41 charged and yet another Isis plot 41:44 hundreds of immigrants from high-risk 41:46 regions have been implicated in 41:48 terrorism inside the united states since 41:52 nine eleven the terrorists who planted 41:55 the bombs in new york and new jersey 41:57 last with and who carried out the mall 42:00 stabbing in Minnesota two weeks ago were 42:02 foreign nationals admitted into our 42:05 country as was the mall shooter in 42:08 Washington State 42:11 no more folks know more now the media 42:15 doesn't want to talk about this they 42:18 really don't just like they don't want 42:20 to show the crowd just like they don't 42:23 want to show 42:25 they never want to show the crowd 42:30 never ever 42:36 you have to go home and you watch and 42:39 you hear this road sounds like you're at 42:41 ohio state football game so you know 42:44 there's thousands and thousands we were 42:48 yesterday in Arizona we had a line that 42:50 was a mile and a half long trying to get 42:52 in 42:52 it's incredible we were in Colorado the 42:55 day before we had a lot you wouldn't 42:57 believe the stadium's we fill up the 42:59 arenas that we fill up and they never 43:02 take the camera off my face 43:05 never people say how is the crowd I said 43:09 didn't you see all I loved your speech 43:11 but didn't you see the crowd i heard but 43:13 they never ever show the crowd and 43:16 that's for good reason they don't want 43:18 to show the crowds because nobody's ever 43:20 had crowds like this and it's not me 43:23 it's you 43:24 this is a movement like never before 43:27 remember 43:48 and believe me the media which is 43:50 totally dishonest is a big big part of 43:53 the problem that our country is having 43:56 these are really dishonest people 44:02 you watch the Clinton news network CNN a 44:07 joke it's actually a joke 44:10 it's a joke and I think most people are 44:15 starting to understand it the good news 44:17 their ratings are being the Boston 44:21 bombers were here on asylum the San 44:25 Bernardino shooter was here through a 44:28 fiance visa sounds so nice doesn't 44:31 fiance visa hall coming in to get 44:33 married from Saudi Arabia right came in 44:38 probably radicalized them

Fifth 47:05 Amendment and got immunity deals 47:26 now we've learned that the FBI made this 47:30 ideal with clinton's top aides that it 47:34 was okay for them to destroy their 47:37 laptops you
