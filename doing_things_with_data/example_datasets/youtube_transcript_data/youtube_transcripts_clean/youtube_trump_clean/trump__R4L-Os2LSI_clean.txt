0:05 please welcome mr. Donald J from 0:09 0:26 0:30 thank you very much thank you ladies and 0:35 gentlemen thank you please sit down 0:39 thank you 0:44 it's my privilege to be here in 0:50 Gettysburg hallowed ground where so many 0:53 lives were given in service to freedom 0:57 amazing place 1:01 President Lincoln served in a time of 1:05 division like we've never seen before 1:09 it is my hope that we can look at his 1:12 example to heal the divisions we are 1:15 living through right now we are a very 1:18 divided nation 1:21 I'm not a politician and I've never 1:24 wanted to be a politician believe 1:31 but when I saw the trouble our country 1:34 was in I knew I couldn't stand by and 1:38 watch any longer 1:40 our country has been so good to me i 1:44 love our country and I felt I had to act 1:54 I've seen the system 1:56 up-close-and-personal for many years 1:59 I've been a major part of it 2:02 I know how the game works in Washington 2:05 and on Wall Street and I know how they 2:07 break the rules of the game against 2:10 everyday Americans the rules are rigged 2:15 nearly one in four Americans in their 2:18 prime earning years isn't even working 2:21 one in five households have no one with 2:26 the job 2:27 45 million Americans or food stamps and 2:31 47 million are living in poverty we have 2:36 failed our inner cities and in so doing 2:38 have failed are african-american and 2:42 Hispanic communities we've missed guided 2:46 military adventures overseas and wars 2:49 that go on forever that just cannot be 2:53 won by the people that are doing it now 2:57 they don't know how to win the wars at 3:01 home we have our great veterans dying 3:04 while waiting for medical care change 3:09 has to come from outside are very broken 3:13 system 3:14 our system is broken the fact that 3:16 Washington and the Washington 3:18 establishment has tried so hard to stop 3:22 our campaign is only more proof that our 3:25 campaign represents the kind of change 3:28 that only arrives once-in-a-lifetime 3:42 the system is totally rigged and broken 3:46 first the issue of voter fraud according 3:53 to you there are 24 million voter 3:57 registrations in the united states that 4:00 are either invalid or significantly 4:03 significantly inaccurate and when I say 4:07 that there are such inaccuracies 4:10 it's unbelievable 1.8 million dead 4:15 people are registered to vote and some 4:20 of them are voted i wonder how that 4:22 happens 4:24 2.8 million people are registered in 4:28 more than one state is a numbers from 4:32 these numbers fourteen percent of 4:36 non-citizens are registered to vote 4:41 the system is also rigged because 4:43 Hillary Clinton should have been 4:45 precluded from running for the 4:48 presidency of the United States but the 4:55 FBI and the Justice Department covered 5:00 up her crimes which included lying to 5:03 the FBI and congress on numerous 5:05 occasions and included saying i do not 5:10 recall to the FBI on 39 separate times 5:16 she recalls everything else but 39 5:21 separate times she said I do not recall 5:25 well that's a lie also 5:34 that there is the deletion of at least 5:37 33,000 emails after receiving a subpoena 5:42 from the United States Congress that's 5:45 after receiving the subpoena as an 5:49 example 5:49 it was announced this week that the 5:52 highly-respected four-star general james 5:55 Cartwright maybe sentence to up to five 5:59 years in prison with a massive fine for 6:03 a lying on one occasion to the FBI and 6:07 he said he did that for national 6:09 security reasons highly respected men a 6:13 four-star general this took place two 6:17 days ago how much he feel a big part of 6:22 the rigging of this election is the fact 6:24 that Hillary is being allowed to run 6:27 despite having broken so many laws on so 6:31 many different occasions 6:33 why is she allowed to run the dishonest 6:37 mainstream media is also part and a 6:41 major part of this corruption 6:50 they're corrupt they lie and fabricate 6:54 stories to make a candidate that is not 6:58 their preferred choice 7:00 look as bad and even dangerous as 7:03 possible at my rallies they never show 7:08 or talk about the massive crowd size and 7:12 try to diminish all of our events on the 7:15 other hand they don't show the small 7:18 sons of Hillary's crowns but in fact 7:21 talk about how many people are there 7:24 very small crowds you know it they know 7:27 it everybody does it over the last two 7:30 days three highly respected national 7:34 polls said we're in first place 7:45 and one of those posters was the most 7:49 accurate pole on the last two cycles but 7:53 the media refuses to even say it or put 7:58 that word out they refused to talk about 8:00 it it's running desperately to suppress 8:04 my vote and the voice of the American 8:07 people as an example of the power 8:10 structure and fighting a TNT is buying 8:13 time water and the CNN a deal we will 8:16 not approve in my administration because 8:19 it's too much concentration of power in 8:23 the hands of to feel 8:32 likewise amazon which through its 8:35 ownership controls the Washington Post 8:38 should be paying massive taxes but it's 8:41 not pain and it's a very unfair 8:44 plainfield and you see what that's 8:47 happening and what that's doing to 8:49 department stores all over the country 8:52 very very unfair and you're talking 8:56 about billions and billions of dollars 8:59 they should be paying those taxes 9:01 additionally comcast purchase of NBC 9:05 concentrates far too much power in one 9:08 massive entity that is trying to tell 9:11 the voters think and what to do deals 9:15 like this destroy democracy and we'll 9:20 look at breaking that deal up and other 9:22 deals like that it should never ever 9:25 have been approved in the first place 9:28 they're trying to poison the mind of the 9:32 American voter every woman lied when 9:38 they came forward to hurt my campaign 9:40 total fabrication 9:45 the events never happened never all of 9:51 these liars and after the election is of 10:02 but a simple phone call placed to the 10:05 biggest newspapers or television 10:07 networks gets them wall-to-wall coverage 10:10 with virtually no fact-checking 10:14 whatsoever 10:16 here is why this is relevant to you if 10:20 they can fight somebody like me who has 10:22 unlimited resources to fight back 10:25 just look at what they can do to you 10:28 your jobs your security your education 10:31 your healthcare the violation of 10:34 religious liberty the theft of your 10:36 second Amendment the loss of your 10:39 factories your homes and much more look 10:42 at what they've done to you with your 10:44 jobs it is just been learned on video 10:49 that the violent protests at some of my 10:53 rallies like in Chicago where police and 10:57 others were seriously hurt you saw that 11:00 blood pouring down their face were 11:03 caused by paid paid DNC and Clinton 11:09 campaign uppers now we didn't know this 11:14 we didn't know this just came out two 11:16 days ago on tape 11:18 we didn't know this we were amazed at 11:20 the level of violence 11:22 these will paid operatives paid by the 11:25 DNC and probably the Clinton campaign 11:28 this is the criminal act policemen were 11:32 badly hurt and so were many others and 11:35 these people should be prosecuted but 11:42 but because of the rig system they 11:47 probably won't be just like we found out 11:50 about these paid violent protesters it 11:53 was probably the DNC and the Clinton 11:56 campaign that put forward these Liars 11:59 with their fabricated stories but we'll 12:01 find out about their involvement at a 12:04 later date through litigation and I look 12:07 so forward to the rigging of the system 12:15 is designed for one reason to keep the 12:18 corrupt establishment and special 12:20 interests in power at your expense and 12:24 everybody's expense i have no special 12:27 interest but you the American verbal 12:37 I didn't have to do this believe me 12:40 there's nothing easy about it but I had 12:44 to do it i love our country i love the 12:45 people of our country and I felt I had 12:48 to 12:52 thank you one thing we all know is that 12:56 we will never sell our problems by 12:58 relying on the same politicians who 13:01 created these problems in the first 13:03 place 13:04 Hillary Clinton is not running against 13:07 me she's running against change and 13:11 she's running against all of the 13:13 American people and all of the American 13:16 voters we now find ourselves at that 13:25 very special fork in the road do we 13:29 repeat the mistakes of the past or do we 13:31 choose to believe that a great future 13:34 yet unwritten still lies ahead for us 13:37 and for our wonderful beloved country i 13:42 think it does and no against my economic 13:46 plan will deliver at least 25 million 13:49 jobs in one decade now our jobs have 13:53 been taken away they've got to Mexico 13:56 they've gone to so many other countries 13:58 it's a one lane highway where they get 14:02 the jobs they get the factories they get 14:05 the money and we get the drugs and we 14:08 get the unemployment and it's going to 14:11 change 14:12 believe me that's going to change 14:19 and that goes for all countries when you 14:22 look at China when you look at every 14:24 country every trade deal we have is 14:27 horrible and we should be ashamed of a 14:30 people and the people that let those 14:33 deals happen the defective and they knew 14:36 they were defective and they were done 14:39 for a reason and believe me they will be 14:42 unwound so fast and we will have trade 14:45 we will have great trade and it'll be 14:47 free trade but it will be fair trade and 14:50 it'll be real my security plan so 14:54 important 14:55 they've taken the jobs from us my 14:58 security plan will bring safety to our 15:01 poorest communities my ethics plan will 15:06 end the corruption in our government we 15:10 were corruption is massive 15:17 you will drain the swamp in Washington 15:20 DC 15:24 and replace it with a new government of 15:27 By and For the People that is why I have 15:34 chosen Gettysburg to unveil this 15:38 contract i'm asking the American people 15:40 to rise above the noise and the clutter 15:43 of our broken politics and to embrace 15:45 that great faith and optimism that has 15:48 always been the central ingredient in 15:51 the American character and there's 15:54 nothing better or stronger than the 15:56 American character i am asking the 16:05 American people to dream big 16:08 once again what follows is my 100th day 16:11 action plan to make America great again 16:15 it's a contract between Donald J Trump 16:19 and the American voter and it begins 16:21 with bringing honesty accountability and 16:24 change to washington DC 16:30 therefore on the first day of my term of 16:37 office my administration will 16:39 immediately pursue the following six 16:41 measures to clean up the corruption and 16:43 special-interest collusion in Washington 16:46 first a constitutional amendment to 16:50 oppose term limits on all members of 16:53 Congress 16:58 second the hiring freeze on all federal 17:03 employees to reduce federal workforce 17:05 through attrition exempting military 17:08 Public Safety and public health 17:15 third requirement that for every new 17:19 federal regulation to existing 17:22 regulations must be eliminated 17:25 regulations are killing our country and 17:28 our jobs for a five-year band on White 17:33 House and congressional officials 17:35 becoming lobbyists after they leave 17:37 government songs making a fortune fifth 17:43 a lifetime ban on white house officials 17:47 lobbying on behalf of a farming 17:50 government six a complete ban on foreign 17:56 lobbyists raising money for American 17:59 elections 18:00 what's happening on the same day i will 18:05 begin taking and really taking strongly 18:09 seven actions to protect American 18:12 workers are American workers have been 18:15 treated so badly by politicians that 18:19 don't have their interest in heart and 18:22 we're going to change that we're going 18:24 to change that very very fast 18:27 first I will announce my intention to 18:29 totally renegotiate NAFTA one of the 18:33 worst deals our country has ever made 18:36 signed by Bill Clinton always draw from 18:40 the deal under Article 2205 second i 18:44 will announce our withdrawal from the 18:47 trans-pacific partnership a potential 18:51 disaster 18:53 for our country third I will direct my 18:57 secretary of the Treasury to labor China 19:00 a currency manipulator 19:03 china is a currency manipulator what 19:06 they have done to us by playing currency 19:09 is very said and I don't blame them 19:12 they've been very smart i blame our 19:15 politicians for letting this take place 19:18 so easy to stop so easy to stand for i 19:24 will direct the Secretary of Commerce 19:25 and US Trade Representative to identify 19:29 all foreign trading abuses that unfairly 19:31 impact American workers and direct them 19:34 to use every tool under American and 19:37 international law to end those abuses 19:41 immediately felt very importantly I will 19:49 lift the restrictions on the production 19:52 of 50 trillion dollars worth of job 19:55 producing American energy reserves 19:58 including share oil natural gas and 20:06 clean call and we will put our miners 20:09 back to work 20:13 6i will lift the obama-clinton 20:17 roadblocks that allow for this vital 20:21 energy infrastructure projects to go 20:25 forward we have roadblocks like you've 20:28 never ever seen environmental blocks 20:32 structural blocks we're going to allow 20:35 the Keystone pipeline and so many other 20:38 things to Moviefone tremendous numbers 20:42 of jobs and good for our country 20:45 we're going to cancel billions in 20:47 payments to the united nations climate 20:50 change programs and use the money to fix 20:54 America's water and environmental 20:57 infrastructure were paying billions and 21:01 billions and billions of dollars 21:04 we're gonna fix our own environment 21:12 additionally on the first day i will 21:14 take the following five actions to 21:16 restore security and constitutional rule 21:20 of law we have to do that 21:22 cancel every unconstitutional executive 21:25 action memorandum and order issued by 21:29 president obama 21:40 second begin the process of selecting a 21:43 replacement for justice scalia whose 21:47 life by the way has a trump sign his 21:50 wife is a phenomenal woman has a trump 21:52 sign in her front yard is not know i 21:58 just found that out this morning mom is 22:01 that nice he was great from one of the 22:04 20 judges on my list you know we're 22:06 going to make great decisions from 20 22:08 outstanding judges on a list that we 22:10 submitted who will uphold and defend the 22:13 Constitution of the United States third 22:21 we will cancel all federal funding of 22:26 sanctuary cities 22:33 or we will begin removing the more than 22:38 two million criminal illegal immigrants 22:41 from the country 22:42 these are drug dealers gang heads gang 22:46 members killers and cancel visas to 22:51 foreign countries that won't take them 22:54 back 22:55 23:00 and when Hillary Clinton was Secretary 23:02 of State and they had someone who is bad 23:06 really bad and they brought him back to 23:08 the country in the country wouldn't take 23:09 them she said we'll bring them back 23:12 we don't want to force to cut you to 23:13 take them they won't be one such 23:15 instance if I become president we're 23:23 going to suspend immigration from Terra 23:26 prone regions where vetting cannot 23:29 safely occur 23:31 23:35 and if you look at Syria and the 23:40 migration we're taking in thousands and 23:43 thousands of people into our country we 23:45 have no idea who they are what their 23:49 thought process is where they come from 23:51 and Hillary Clinton wants to increase 23:54 the number of those thousands and 23:57 thousands currently pouring in by five 24:00 hundred and fifty percent radical 24:04 Islamic terror is right around the 24:07 corner we have to be so tough so smart 24:11 so vigilant 24:12 we can't allow that to happen we have 24:15 enough problems all that into people 24:22 coming into our country will be 24:23 considered extreme vetting will be very 24:26 careful 24:27 next I will work with Congress to 24:29 introduce the following broader 24:31 legislative measures and fight for their 24:33 passage within the first 100 days of my 24:37 administration middle class tax relief 24:40 and simplification act and economic plan 24:45 designed to grow the economy four 24:47 percent per year and create at least 25 24:50 million new jobs through massive tax 24:52 reduction and simplification in 24:54 combination with great reform regulatory 24:58 relief and lifting the restrictions on 25:01 American energy so bad jobs we need jobs 25:08 our jobs have left us are good jobs have 25:11 really left us the largest tax 25:14 reductions are for the middle class who 25:18 have been forgotten called the forgotten 25:22 man and woman have been forgotten the 25:25 middle class with family of two children 25:28 will get basically approximately 25:30 thirty-five percent tax cut and that's 25:33 what they can use and that money will go 25:35 back into the 25:41 the current number of brackets will be 25:43 reduced from seven to three and tax 25:47 forms will likewise be greatly 25:49 simplified the business rate will be 25:56 lower from 35% to fifteen percent and 26:00 the trillions of dollars of American 26:02 corporate money overseas can now be 26:05 brought back at a ten percent rate it's 26:08 stuck 26:09 we can't bring it back two and a half to 26:11 five trillion dollars companies can't 26:14 get it back into the country some 26:17 companies are actually leaving not only 26:18 because taxes are so high but because 26:21 they can't get their money and they are 26:23 actually leaving to get their money 26:25 we're going to simplify that we're going 26:27 to have them bring to our country and 26:30 use the money and spend the money on 26:32 building our country 26:34 26:41 and the offshoring act established 26:45 tariffs to discourage companies from 26:48 laying off their workers in order to 26:50 relocate in other countries and ship 26:52 their products back to the United States 26:55 tax-free they leave the United States 26:58 like carrier like forward like so many 27:01 others they leave the United States a 27:04 fire all of their employees they go to 27:06 Mexico or another country they build a 27:08 beautiful brand-new plant they hire 27:10 other people they then take their air 27:12 conditioners their cars whatever then 27:14 making they send it tax-free across what 27:17 will be a very strong border believe me 27:19 but they send it tax-free across the 27:24 border and what are we end up with we 27:27 have unemployment tremendous losses and 27:31 we have none of the benefits so we will 27:34 establish tariffs that when they do that 27:37 there will be consequences will work 27:39 with them will be nice 27:41 will be fair but they have to be 27:43 consequences and when they know their 27:45 consequences are companies will stop 27:48 leaving the United States and going to 27:51 other conscience 27:55 the American infrastructure leverages 27:58 public-private partnerships and private 28:01 investments through tax incentives to 28:03 spur one trillion dollars in 28:05 infrastructure investment over the next 28:08 ten years our infrastructure is in such 28:11 trouble we've doubled our national debt 28:14 to 20 trillion dollars under president 28:18 obama in less than 8 years 10 trillion 28:24 dollars has been added think of it and 28:27 we haven't fixed anything we haven't 28:29 fixed anything 28:30 what if we've done our roads are broken 28:32 our bridges or tunnels or hospitals or 28:33 schools and we have 20 trillion in debt 28:37 all-time high 28:40 that's true are VA hospitals are in bad 28:43 shape in RVA is and very very bad shape 28:46 and we will fix that we are going to 28:48 work on fixing that because our veterans 28:51 have not been treated properly we have 28:55 illegal immigrants that are treated far 28:57 better in many instances that our 28:59 veterans and we're not going to have 29:01 that school choice and education 29:06 opportunity and redirects education 29:08 dollars to give parents the right to 29:10 send their kit their children to public 29:13 private charter magnet religious or 29:17 homeschools of their choice 29:21 and so importantly we're going to end 29:27 common core and bring education 29:29 supervision to local communities we do 29:35 so badly on education if you look at the 29:38 lists and you see sweet norway denmark 29:40 China different countries at the time 29:43 UCS at the bottom and yet by far 29:47 per-pupil more money than anybody and 29:51 it's not even close we spend more money 29:53 for people than anybody not even plus 29:56 with the bottom of the list other 29:58 countries spending far less for people 30:00 are at the top of the list so obviously 30:03 our current system is not working we 30:07 will change it and we will make it good 30:12 it expands vocational and Technical 30:15 Education which we've totally forgotten 30:17 about in this country and make two and 30:20 four-year colleges more affordable 30:23 have you ever gone to school and you've 30:25 been with people that are good students 30:27 but they can fix an engine or they can 30:30 build a wall or they can do things that 30:33 you wouldn't even think about because we 30:35 can use some of the ones who build the 30:37 wall 30:37 we're going to enable 30:42 we're going to do 30:47 but did you ever see that how their 30:49 genius at fixing a car they can do 30:51 anything but history not-so-good physics 30:55 not so good we have to open vocational 30:58 again those are the people that gives a 31:01 great people 31:04 the repeal and replace Obamacare act 31:08 31:13 fully repeal Obamacare and replace it 31:17 with health savings account so we could 31:19 do that the health savings accounts to 31:22 one way there are numerous ways but this 31:25 is one very good way the ability to 31:27 purchase health insurance across state 31:29 lines to have to do because that's 31:31 competition the politicians won't let go 31:34 of it because the insurance companies 31:36 they don't want competition but we'll 31:39 open it up believe me we'll get rid of 31:40 that I've been saying it for years and 31:42 let States manage Medicaid funds it will 31:45 be so reforms will also include cutting 31:51 the red tape at the FDA there are over 31:53 4,000 drugs awaiting approval and we 31:56 especially want to speed the approval of 31:58 life-saving medications mean they're 32:02 looking at drugs that are looking very 32:05 good and you have terminal patients that 32:09 it's over these people that dying they 32:13 want to get the drug they won't be 32:16 living much longer and we study it for 32:18 years and years at some point they have 32:22 to do what they have to do they have to 32:24 do it properly we're four thousand 32:27 different drugs and products waiting in 32:29 line for approval we can't get them 32:31 approved we're going to speed up that 32:33 process very significantly affordable 32:36 childcare and Elder Care Act allows 32:39 Americans to deduct childcare and elder 32:41 care from their taxes incentivizes 32:44 employers to provide on-site so 32:48 important childcare services and you see 32:50 that with a couple of companies and it's 32:52 such a great thing to see and creates 32:55 tax-free dependent care savings accounts 32:57 were both young and elderly dependence 32:59 with matching contributions for 33:02 low-income families so good 33:05 and illegal immigration act fully fund 33:15 the construction of the wall on our 33:18 southern border don't worry about it 33:20 remember I said Mexico's paying for the 33:22 war with the full understanding that the 33:26 country of Mexico will be reimbursing 33:30 the United States for the fold cost of 33:32 such a wall 33:33 ok we're going to have the wall Mexico's 33:36 gonna pay for the wall 33:37 Mexico's by the way I met with the 33:40 President of Mexico two-and-a-half 33:43 months ago wonderful meeting wonderful 33:45 person but I told him to sit two-way 33:49 Highway not a one-way highway we have 33:53 our we have to take care of our people 33:56 have to protect our people so it's going 33:58 to be a two-way street 34:00 otherwise going to be a whole different 34:02 deal but establishes a two-year 34:05 mandatory minimum federal prison 34:08 sentences of people coming into lately 34:10 for illegally re-entering the United 34:13 States after a previous deportation and 34:16 a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally 34:21 reentering for those with felony 34:23 convictions multiple misdemeanor 34:26 convictions or two or more prior 34:29 deportations so when somebody comes in 34:32 we send them out they come back in to go 34:35 to prison quite a while they come back 34:38 they come back again they go five years 34:41 because what's happening is they're 34:43 coming back ten times and I could go 34:46 case after case they come back 34:48 look at what happened in San Francisco 34:51 five times he came back on the fifth 34:54 time he killed Kate five times but so 34:57 many others 110 times came back killed 35:00 somebody after ten times when they get 35:02 deported they stay out otherwise they 35:05 have very serious prison terms they will 35:08 stay out once you do that they will stay 35:11 out right now that 35:12 have no consequence they have no 35:14 consequences also reforms or visa rules 35:18 to enhance penalties for overstaying and 35:21 to ensure open jobs are offered to 35:24 american workers first number 83 story 35:30 Community Safety and reduces searching 35:33 crime drugs and violence by creating a 35:35 task force on violent crime and 35:38 increasing funding for programs that 35:39 train and assist your local police were 35:43 doing such a great job 35:45 believe me we increase the resources for 35:51 federal law enforcement agencies and 35:53 federal prosecutors to dismantle 35:55 criminal gangs and put violent offenders 35:58 behind bars or out of our country and 36:01 into the country where they came from 36:03 restoring National Security Act which we 36:11 bills are military by eliminating the 36:13 defense sequester which has been very 36:16 tough on military and expanding military 36:19 investment now at no time practically do 36:23 we need a military like right now we 36:27 don't want to use it but its peace 36:29 through strength we need a strong 36:33 military our military is so terribly 36:37 depleted 36:40 it also provides a great veterans with 36:43 the ability to receive public VA 36:45 treatment or attend a private doctor of 36:48 their choice if they're waiting on line 36:50 and i have the plan up and we've gotten 36:53 as you know tremendous support from 36:56 veterans from law enforcement from 36:59 veterans from the military tremendous 37:01 support but if they're waiting on line 37:04 and you see 22 suicides a day people 37:07 don't even believe 22 day but if they're 37:10 waiting on line 47 days six days nine 37:13 days they can't get to see a doctor and 37:17 a simple procedure or a simple 37:19 prescription can solve their problem and 37:22 they become very sick and they die they 37:25 die waiting in line we're going to give 37:28 them the power to go across the street 37:30 to a local doctor a private doctor a 37:33 public hospital or private hospital all 37:36 looking to help and all looking to do 37:38 business and will pay the bill so much 37:41 cheaper but much more importantly the 37:43 veterans will finally be taken care of 37:45 properly because what they're going 37:47 through now is hungry 37:51 also we're going to protect our vital 37:56 infrastructure from the new thing it's 37:59 called cyber attack it establishes new 38:03 screening procedures for immigration to 38:05 ensure those who are admitted to our 38:07 country support our people and our 38:10 values we want people that love our 38:12 country or candle of our country and 38:15 people that will love our citizens we 38:18 want people that can love us and there 38:21 are ways through talent of determining 38:25 that and other countries do but we don't 38:28 just come on in folks come on it clean 38:32 up corruption in Washington in acts 38:35 tough new ethic reforms to reduce the 38:39 corrupting influence of special 38:40
