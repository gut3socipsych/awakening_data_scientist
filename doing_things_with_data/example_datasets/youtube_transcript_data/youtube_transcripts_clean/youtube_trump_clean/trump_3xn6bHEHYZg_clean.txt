0:41 you 0:47 they're telling bitches because when I 0:49 look at all of the Willing rallies I 0:51 think we're going to do very well with 0:53 women for Trump 0:58 anything days we're going to win the 1:01 state of North Carolina 1:05 the white our mornings have spent more 1:10 money that ever before in history of 1:13 this campaign 1:14 they've raised it from special interests 1:17 and yet we are leading three recent 1:19 polls it just came out over the last day 1:26 let's change times and investors 1:30 business daily mission log siding with 1:33 the land lords and Kelly most will eat 1:36 it whole and by the way last cycle was 1:39 as they tell me the most accurate pole 1:41 of the last cycle so that's a good side 1:46 that's a good sign because I honestly 1:49 believe we're going to win this is 1:51 what's going to happen we have two great 1:58 congressman of the group and they told 2:01 me what's going on to their districts 2:03 it's unbelievable their areas 2:06 unbelievable 2:07 Jimmy Duncan of Tennessee is here 2:09 someplace we can be doctored Jimmy 2:11 incredible guy and he said you won't 2:15 believe what's happening in Tennessee 2:17 and Mark meadows 2:20 did you ever hear walk 2:23 and much more importantly his wife the 2:27 real leader in the family right 2:29 thank you Mark thank you for being here 2:30 thank you about her much he's a great 2:33 people but they're just telling me the 2:35 level of excitement and the people 2:38 coming out i think we're going to have 2:39 beyond the brexit I think we'll go 2:42 beyond direction you know about 4i think 2:47 we're gonna have early voting is 2:50 underway so make sure you send in your 2:52 ballot weekend that take a chance of 2:54 blowing it 2:54 we can not take a chance we have 2:58 something with so close it's a movement 3:01 like they've never seen in this country 3:02 before never ever seen 3:04 don't blow it on November a together 3:10 we're going to deliver real change that 3:13 puts America first we're going to 3:16 renegotiate our terrible trade deals and 3:19 illegal immigration stop the massive 3:22 inflow of refugees we just searching 3:25 crime cut taxes and regulation so 3:34 and Hilary is going to raise your taxes 3:37 big leg you've seen that 3:41 we're going to unleash job producing 3:44 American energy rebuild our military and 3:48 take care of our veterans of not 3:50 position 3:56 and of course one of the true staples to 4:01 my campaign and I say to our campaign 4:04 repeal and replace Obamacare 4:16 your jobs will come back under a trump 4:18 administration your incomes will go up 4:21 under a trump administration your taxes 4:24 will go way way down under a trump 4:27 administer your company's won't be 4:32 leaving North Carolina under a trump 4:34 administration there will be 4:36 consequences for them we will be strong 4:41 and really strong and powerful nation 4:45 again our military so depleted we're 4:48 going to build it up America has grown 4:51 weak and so weak that the Philippines 4:54 have broken with decades of pro American 4:57 foreign policy to instead leave for the 5:01 orbit of China and Russia you saw that 5:03 yesterday the hatred I mean why is Obama 5:08 campaigning he would be out working he 5:12 ought to be out 5:20 I mean I'm gonna send the congressman 5:22 back to Washington with that message but 5:24 we'll send the real message on november 5:27 eight right send the wrong message 5:33 but every time I look at least 5:35 campaigning and here you see the 5:36 Philippines the heads of the Philippines 5:38 is so angry he leaves the China is now 5:42 negotiated with China we've been to the 5:44 Philippines practically for forever a 5:47 very important strategic Ally and what 5:51 happens 5:52 China and Russia are probably going to 5:55 take it and I see him out there 5:56 campaigning for crooked Hillary come on 6:02 strength will also require growth right 6:07 now our economy isn't growing at all 6:10 we had only around a one percent growth 6:12 last quarter gdp a disaster you know 6:18 when China has 1% it's over 6:22 they don't have one percent they have 6:24 seven percent that's considered terrible 6:27 india has eight percent that's 6:29 considered bad for them they don't like 6:31 it we have one percent and everything 6:33 supposed to be fine but we're going down 6:35 if hillary gets in 6:37 she's gonna raise your taxes and the one 6:39 percent is going to be negative and 6:41 that's going to be almost unheard of but 6:42 that's gonna happen i made a lot of 6:44 predictions if that happens and if she 6:48 gets in 6:49 you're going to have such negative 6:51 growth you will have problems like 6:53 you've never had before and our 6:56 companies and our jobs will flee 7:00 believe me i'm going to get us to four 7:03 percent growth and create 25 million 7:05 jobs over 10 years 7:12 many workers are earning less today than 7:15 they were 18 years ago they're working 7:18 harder and longer and then making less 7:21 some of them are working two jobs and 7:24 even three jobs but still taking home 7:28 less pay than they were taking home 18 7:32 and 20 years ago but i'm working order 7:35 to folks i will i am walking on there's 7:38 no doubt about it i've got three stops 7:40 to them 7:41 we've got three of these today three 7:49 well I've got three an occasion i have 7:54 four i think i have one rest day where i 7:57 have to but these are massive rallies 8:00 and we're gonna do this for another 19 8:03 days right up until the actual vote of 8:09 november a and then I don't know what 8:11 kind of shape from it but i'll be happy 8:13 and at least i will have known 8:15 win lose or draw and i'm almost sure if 8:18 the people come out we're gonna win but 8:21 will be I will be happy with myself 8:26 because i always say i don't want to 8:28 think back if only I did one more rally 8:30 I would have one north carolina by 500 8:35 votes instead of losing it by 200 votes 8:37 right if only I did so I what I never 8:41 want to ever look back I never want to 8:43 say that about myself 8:44 we have to work you have to get 8:46 everybody you know out there 8:49 companies like carrier are firing their 8:52 workers and moving to Mexico for is 8:56 moving all of its small car production 8:58 announced two weeks ago to Mexico that's 9:01 on top of a two-and-a-half million 9:03 dollar plant that they already built 9:05 when I'm president if companies want to 9:09 fire their workers and leave for Mexico 9:11 or other parts of the world there will 9:14 be a tax of thirty-five percent for any 9:18 product they want to shipping 9:21 with this country and you know what's 9:25 gonna happen because I'm a free trader 9:28 lot of people don't believe that I'm a 9:31 free trader but our politicians have 9:34 made such horrible trade deals that 9:37 they're killing our workers they're 9:39 killing our companies and our companies 9:41 are being forced to move including the 9:42 fact the taxes so I but there will be 9:45 consequences and we're not going to lose 9:48 the company in North Carolina have them 9:50 go to Mexico or someplace else make 9:53 their products sell it back in here 9:54 which we will have a very strong border 9:57 but selling through a border and there 9:59 are no consequences and i'll tell you 10:01 what's gonna happen when we do this for 10:03 years 10:04 our government has tried to stop our 10:07 companies are believing guess what's 10:10 gonna happen then i can leave anymore 10:12 because all of a sudden it won't work if 10:15 they do at least we're gonna make a lot 10:17 of money when they ship their products 10:20 across the border 10:22 ok 10:26 the politicians have never even heard 10:28 that you've heard it for me over the 10:30 last six months for me it was so simple 10:32 you want to move 10:33 good luck enjoy the heat and let me tell 10:36 you when you make your air conditioner 10:39 you make your car you do this you're 10:41 going to leave all those people on a 10:43 blood there are consequences 10:45 you gonna pay a terror attacks Hillary 10:47 Clinton is raised countless millions of 10:49 dollars and they're not leaving from big 10:52 daughters who want to ship our jobs to 10:54 other countries including millions of 10:57 dollars from corporations and countries 10:59 pushing for the next NAFTA the next 11:04 horrible trade deal it's called the 11:06 trans-pacific partnership don't let it 11:08 happen that will be the rest of your 11:10 jobs will be gone the rest of your job 11:13 that's how our system is corrupt and 11:16 broken we're going to take on big domes 11:20 we're going to take on big business and 11:22 big media that have been rich themselves 11:26 at your expense and I didn't need to do 11:28 this folks and I was part of the other 11:31 side for a long time I understand the 11:33 game as well as anybody as well as 11:35 anybody but I saw the game and I saw it 11:38 firsthand and this country has been 11:40 great to me i love this country and I 11:43 said our country will not survive if we 11:46 continue to play that game 11:49 so this is always a tough thing to do 11:51 but I'm doing it and I am so invigorated 11:55 by the kind of reception is to the 11:57 corners of 12:00 make America great again what we're 12:04 gonna do 12:05 it's all about making America great 12:07 again we're gonna do it and I understand 12:09 it i understand it from both sides 12:11 believe me and I think you know that 12:13 thank you the media is so corrupt that 12:17 every was given the exact questions to a 12:19 previous debate to remember this just 12:22 recently word-for-word given the 12:25 questions here the questions here are 12:29 the questions nobody gave me the 12:31 question now I don't know what I do 12:33 would i turn the people in but what I 12:36 take the questions she was given the 12:40 question I think I turned and I think 12:42 it's a wonder what's going on over you 12:45 I want to know where she given the 12:46 questions to my bed but it doesn't 12:49 matter because we want 12:54 based on everything we want i hope that 12:57 especially the last I think the first 12:59 one you know was fine i thought it was 13:02 good i mean i never did this stuff 13:04 before in all fairness but i think we 13:06 did well i think i think it was good 13:08 that they gave me you know this great 13:10 commission on public on presidential 13:12 debates they're wonderful except they 13:14 gave me a broken bike but that's okay 13:16 screaming into the mic all night but I 13:19 think the first one was fine and I think 13:20 we won easily the second one and the 13:23 third one was our best right third 13:27 but she was given the questions to a 13:32 debate by donna Brazile who is now under 13:37 pressure to resign to shipping she 13:40 should resign but is you 13:44 why didn't Hillary say I can't do this I 13:50 can't do this I can take 13:52 I can't take these question nobody from 13:54 the media's asking that question why is 13:57 it they're putting a lot of pressure on 13:59 Donna Brazile she was on television the 14:02 other night it was brutal 14:04 they're putting a lot of pressure but 14:06 tell me she handed the questions to 14:10 Hillary Hillary read the crisis figured 14:13 out the answers but whatever she had to 14:15 do and then why didn't she say I'm not 14:19 allowed to do this years ago years ago 14:24 there was a show called the 14:27 sixty-four-thousand-dollar question does 14:29 anybody remember don't say because it's 14:31 all around a contestant Charles go ahead 14:38 why correct wow how do you know it look 14:42 at young this guy i can test it got the 14:47 questions in advance 14:50 prior to the show and his life was 14:53 ruined but Hillary got the questions in 14:56 advance and the press doesn't even bring 14:59 it up 15:00 can you imagine if I got the questions 15:04 in advance and they found out to you 15:08 can you imagine if I got the questions 15:11 and they found out that would reinvent a 15:16 much more sinister form of the electric 15:18 chair is era yo do but I asked the press 15:23 to find out why are they asking Hillary 15:27 why she didn't turn in the people that 15:31 gave her the answers and those questions 15:37 but this is even bigger than what we're 15:40 talking about because we're playing for 15:42 the presidency of the United States 15:44 Hillary is the most corrupt politician 15:50 every receipt the office of the 15:53 presidency 16:03 haha 16:05 haha 16:06 haha 16:07 haha 16:09 haha 16:10 haha 16:12 haha 16:13 Oh 16:15 well let's do this let's do this 16:18 november eight let's win we win we have 16:28 lots of options but we gotta win 16:32 what a waste of time if we don't pull 16:34 this off you know these guys have said 16:37 it doesn't matter if you win or lose 16:39 there's never been a movement like this 16:40 in the history of this country i say it 16:42 matters to me whether we want to lose 16:44 because so so i'll have over a hundred 16:50 million dollars of my own money in this 16:52 campaign so if i loose my lover's i will 16:56 consider this and the nice part about 16:58 saying that and I only tell you that 16:59 because that means i'm not taking all of 17:01 his money from all of these people that 17:03 Hillary's taking money and you know her 17:07 husband make 250 billion dollars i said 17:10 to the second demands it 17:12 so why aren't you putting five million 17:14 10 million 1525 what I'm putting it over 17:18 a hundred why aren't you putting in 10 17:20 million dollars into your own campaign 17:22 they're not putting anything and we're 17:24 fighting this juggling up because their 17:25 billions of dollars savers and we're 17:28 fighting 17:29 I turned on the other diners in florida 17:31 and i resent Pennsylvania I turned on 17:34 the television it was and after and 17:37 after ed most of those ads were 40 years 17:40 most of the things that those eggs were 17:42 false 17:43 they were false I never said it 17:46 they know I didn't say they have 17:48 different things the way i won't go into 17:52 things there's my people go crazy with 17:54 this they don't be particularly just I 17:56 liked it then I think like that because 17:59 what they say go talk about jobs but 18:02 these things are so false all of these 18:04 things is so forces socialize but 18:06 Hillary it's and after a day after and 18:09 all paid for by wall street and 18:11 special-interest all pay and i'm sending 18:14 myself i think they said it's Florida 18:16 the number of its going to be 50 to 1 18:19 and we're tied in florida and i think 18:21 we're going to win flow 18:27 but the edge of phony ads they're untrue 18:31 that mostly enter the littler than ever 18:34 muscle and remember when you watching 18:37 television you see one of the thousands 18:40 and thousands of is just remember put 18:42 wallstreet on top its walls but that's 18:44 who paid for the largely pay for now 18:47 from WikiLeaks we've just learned she 18:49 tried to get 12 million dollars from the 18:52 King of Morocco for an appearance more 18:55 pay-for-play 19:02 that's why I'm proposing a past of 19:05 ethics reforms to make our government 19:07 honest once again 19:13 it's time to drain the swamp in 19:16 Washington DC 19:24 those reforms include the following a 19:27 five-year ban on White House and 19:30 congressional officials becoming 19:32 lobbyists after they leave government's 19:34 a lifetime ban on white house officials 19:38 lobbying on behalf of a foreign 19:40 government thank you a complete ban on 19:44 far lobbyists raising money for American 19:47 elections 19:48 additionally i'm going to push for a 19:52 constitutional amendment to oppose term 19:55 limits on all members 20:03 not only will we end government 20:05 corruption but we will end economic 20:08 stagnation so important our country is 20:11 doing poorly my plan for the economy can 20:14 be summed up in three great beautiful 20:17 powerful words jobs jobs jobs they've 20:22 been taken away from me 20:26 at the center of my jobs when will be 20:30 fixing our terrible trade deals they are 20:32 terrible the most incompetent deals ever 20:36 made by the way after signed by Bill 20:38 Clinton thank you very much president 20:40 left 20:41 it's been a one-way highway into Mexico 20:44 for our jobs our cash we get the drugs 20:46 they get the jobs and the cash 47 20:50 million Americans are living in poverty 20:53 and 45 million Americans are right now 20:56 in this country on food stamps we have 20:59 nearly an 800 billion dollar annual 21:02 trade deficit in good with the world and 21:05 the worst so-called recovery since the 21:08 Great Depression North Carolina has lost 21:12 nearly half of its manufacturing jobs 21:15 since NAFTA half he lost half of your 21:18 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA a deal 21:22 signed by bill clinton and strongly 21:25 supported by Hillary listen to this 21:30 we've lost and I always say this it 21:33 sounded like a typographical error it's 21:35 not i thought it would be 700 7,000 21:39 we've lost seventy thousand factories 21:43 since china's entry into the World Trade 21:46 Organization another bill and hillary 21:48 backed deal 21:52 we're living through the greatest jobs 21:55 left in the history of the world 21:58 nobody's ever lost jobs like this the 22:01 deal that you made with South Korea was 22:03 gonna bring us a hundred thousand jobs 22:05 no it's brought them a hundred thousand 22:08 jobs we've lost jobs we don't want 22:10 anymore by the way to get jobs we don't 22:13 want on anything anymore we attack a 22:16 city emotional we attack mozem I've been 22:19 reading about the attack for four months 22:21 the reason they want to attack a primary 22:24 reason is to take the leaders of Isis 22:27 out because that's where they think they 22:29 are and i say whatever happened to a 22:33 surprise attack so i've been reading 22:38 about Mosul in the attack and I talked 22:40 about it at the debate did everyone hear 22:42 me talk about that during the book and I 22:45 said to myself how are you going to get 22:48 these people this is a tough spot people 22:50 what you do is you do a sneak attack or 22:53 a surprise attack right right with you 22:57 predictable we will attack mosel in 23:01 three months from now we are going to 23:03 get their leaders because we believe 23:06 that's where they're staying we believe 23:09 his Obama we believe they are in muzzles 23:13 so in three or four months 23:15 let's see he goes three or four months 23:18 we will be attacking mosel because we 23:21 want to get the leaders of Isis okay 23:23 well in the meantime the following day 23:26 they're out of there they're spread all 23:28 of it applies in the meantime have you 23:31 seen what's going on 23:33 it's much tougher than we thought 23:35 because now they're dug in there ready 23:37 and it's much much tougher than we 23:40 thought 23:41 General Douglas MacArthur General George 23:45 Patton who was to me and to tough today 23:50 he could make it in the armed forces 23:52 because they say he's not politically 23:54 correct get a very foul mouth he's bad 23:58 words but his people loved him 24:01 and his people would die for him but a 24:04 foul mouth but he won he would win 24:07 can you imagine him saying we're going 24:10 to be attacking mosel in four months to 24:13 see we get the leaders and what they're 24:16 finding is taking on I told him that for 24:18 once and what are you mentioned this for 24:20 now they would have said we will never 24:23 ever attack Mosul mosel is that I would 24:28 never do this to me I would because i 24:31 always like to tell the truth but 24:34 somebody could say we will never ever 24:36 attack Muslim and then the next day you 24:41 hit them like you've never ridden that 24:43 would never do i would i would not do it 24:49 we have a bunch of babies running our 24:54 country folks we have a bunch of losers 24:57 their losses their babies we have a 25:00 president only wants to do is campaign 25:03 his wife all she wants it to his 25:05 campaign and I see how much his wife 25:10 likes Hillary but wasn't she the one 25:12 that originally started this statement 25:15 if you can't take care of your home 25:17 right you can take care of the White 25:20 House of the country where is that I 25:22 don't hear that i don't hear that she's 25:25 the one that started that I said we 25:28 can't say that it's too vicious can you 25:29 believe that I said that we can set they 25:32 said well Michelle Obama said it is that 25:35 she did that she said that but we don't 25:37 hear about that let me tell you if 25:40 Hillary Clinton gets elected we've got 25:44 four more years of Obama we have a 25:47 disaster we have Isis all of we won't 25:51 win any more and your taxes are going up 25:53 and she wants to double up and triple up 25:56 on Obamacare which has to be repealed 25:58 and replaces a disaster a trump 26:01 administration is going to renegotiate 26:04 have to stand up for foreign cheating 26:06 and stop the jobs from leaving our kind 26:10 we are going to start making things in 26:15 America again we are going to start 26:18
