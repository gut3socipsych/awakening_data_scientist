all over it 5:30 has been wild but we had amazing people 5:33 are now up to 19 recipients of the 5:37 congressional medal of honor of endorses 5:39 and we have 200 over 200 as of about two 5:44 days from now over 200 admirals and 5:48 generals and they have been unbelievable 5:51 because they want to see things happen 5:56 correctly not the way they've been 5:58 happening we can't beat anybody right 6:01 now we don't beat Isis can you imagine 6:03 general george patton he's right now 6:06 spinning in his grave 6:08 can you imagine this can you imagine 6:10 General Douglas MacArthur we can't beat 6:13 Isis they wouldn't know what you even 6:15 talking about but I'll tell you one 6:16 thing they wouldn't do they wouldn't go 6:17 on television to announce that very soon 6:20 we're going after mosel did you see that 6:22 they announce we're going after Moses 6:25 why do you have to talk you do it you do 6:28 it 6:36 then you have the leaders of Isis lot of 6:38 Moses they say you know we're getting 6:40 out of here now because they announced 6:41 it will go through the whole thing 6:43 death and destruction and it won't be 6:46 the success it should be 6:47 we've got to keep their mouths shut and 6:50 get it done and every general will say 6:53 you know in the old days that read it 6:57 used to be called the element of 6:59 surprise 7:02 we don't have the surprise anymore folks 7:04 we don't have we have people that truly 7:06 don't know what they're doing running 7:09 our country remember two weeks ago 400 7:13 million in cash 7:15 remember that cash but then that turned 7:18 out to be wrong it looks like it was 1.7 7:21 billion in cash in cash 7:26 that would fill up that piece of the 7:29 arena and then last week 800 people 7:34 ready for deportation to a rough part of 7:37 the world and guess what happened they 7:40 became instead United States citizens 7:43 and that was wrong also because it 7:47 turned out not to be 800 people they 7:50 think now it's 1700 people so I 7:56 immediately said okay so fix it 7:58 Oh undo it and you know what they said 8:01 well that wouldn't be constitutional 8:06 how stupid are we the world is laughing 8:10 anyway 8:13 colorado is home to six great military 8:17 bases with unbelievable people stationed 8:21 at those 8:24 we're going to eliminate the defense 8:27 sequester rebuild our military and take 8:30 care of our veterans have to do it we 8:32 have to take care of our vets 8:38 we have illegal immigrants in many cases 8:40 treated better than our veterans that's 8:42 not going to happen for long 8:45 another great Colorado legacy is hunting 8:48 and fishing my son loved their here all 8:52 the time we're going to conserve your 8:55 land for future generations and we are 8:58 going to save your second Amendment 8:59 which is under sieved 9:07 undersea and as you know the NRA endorse 9:12 me with the earliest endorsement they've 9:14 ever given so thank you for that 9:19 you Gunners better get out there and 9:21 vote I'll tell you better get out 9:24 you're not gonna like it if they get in 9:27 and all of a sudden rules and 9:30 regulations are put in it won't be the 9:32 same 9:33 we have to preserve we have to preserve 9:35 and protect our Second Amendment we ask 9:38 one other issue of such great importance 9:45 to colorado is energy Hillary Clinton 9:47 wants to shut down the mines 9:50 she also wants to shut down shell energy 9:52 production denying you billions of 9:55 dollars in wealth and of course a 9:57 billions and hundreds of millions of 9:59 jobs in terms of dollars we can't let 10:02 that happen remember it was drinking 10:05 Hillary who said by the time we get 10:08 through all of my conditions i do not 10:11 think there will be many places in 10:14 America where fracking will continue to 10:16 take place a lot of people 10:19 that's a lot of jobs and what we want to 10:23 compete with other countries we better 10:25 not think that way because we are losing 10:27 out big-league she also wants to shut 10:30 down oil and natural gas production her 10:32 anti energy policies will take millions 10:36 of jobs from Colorado Pennsylvania Ohio 10:39 Florida and so many other states we are 10:43 going to end Hillary Clinton's war on 10:46 colorado energy and we're going to put 10:48 our miners back to work our miners are 10:53 going back 10:58 well my opponent focuses on small petty 11:02 things we are discussing the vital 11:05 issues facing our country and our people 11:07 and we have many many vital issues we 11:11 are going to talk borders we're going to 11:14 talk trade jobs and refugees we're going 11:23 to talk about trying and failing schools 11:26 and how to turn our country around 11:28 Hillary can't discuss the issues because 11:31 she's one of the ones who helped create 11:33 the problems in the first place or she 11:37 could accuse the country of and you saw 11:41 that the other day and the other night 11:43 is racism and attack Trump voters and 11:47 Bernie voters that you see where she 11:49 attacked the Bernie voters Bernie should 11:53 have never made a deal with the devil he 11:57 would have gone down as having done 11:59 something amazing and now was thrown out 12:01 the window and she'll do everything she 12:04 can to distract from the issues and her 12:07 enormous corruption and criminal conduct 12:09 a campaign of distraction funded by Wall 12:12 Street investors and hedge fund managers 12:16 these special interests are counting on 12:18 Hillary to keep reading the system as 12:21 she's done her whole career all that 12:24 stands between you and the country you 12:27 want our Hillary Clinton special 12:30 entrance and all you have to do to beat 12:32 those special interests is male in those 12:35 ballots and get out to vote or November 12:39 all you have to do 12:49 oh I wish those cameras words that would 12:53 you do me a favor fell to spend the room 12:54 span the room God spamming 13:01 span the room 13:04 pretty amazed 13:07 places new wrecker 13:11 places 13:37 they never show our crowds never maybe 13:45 i'll just wait into the crowd maybe that 13:47 whether they never 13:52 and in fact tonight when you go home 13:54 because I just look behind the smaller 13:58 section is right behind me because we 14:01 have the flag and the flag of Colorado 14:06 so we have so all you see is my face and 14:09 a few people but negative become movie 14:11 stars very attractive people 14:13 you're not going to see this because 14:15 they never shall because it's bad to 14:18 show it because if they show it they're 14:20 going to see what's happening 14:33 and they don't see that this is going 14:35 all the way up to the rafters and we 14:40 love our flag but i think i'm going to 14:41 move it a little bit in this direction 14:42 next time because they're going to show 14:46 how many rows right strap 14:50 nice but you understand what I'm saying 14:52 my people don't get it my people don't 14:57 they don't get it my people but if they 15:00 would span the crowd and this is what we 15:03 have no matter where we go it's only 15:05 dictated by the size of the arena right 15:08 by the side we went to play below today 15:10 we had a tremendous ground right all 15:14 dictated by the size of Louisville and I 15:18 want to thank our fire marshal who was 15:20 fantastic 15:21 he was fantastic to allow to allow so 15:26 many people into the building they have 15:27 people standing in every door but i 15:29 always say how can you have a fire it's 15:30 a concrete floor but i want to thank the 15:35 fire marshals they were fantastic and I 15:37 want to thank our police 15:38 what a job they do want you 15:45 water job 15:47 I've made a centerpiece of my economic 15:50 revitalization plan the largest middle 15:53 class tax cut and this is this is big 15:55 stuff the largest tax cut since Ronald 15:59 Reagan at the largest regulator right 16:03 the largest regulatory reform in 16:06 American history so we have the big tax 16:09 cut and for companies will bring it down 16:12 from 35 to 50 present our companies are 16:15 leaving our country and will bring it 16:18 way down to 12 and a half percent for 16:20 middle-income 20 for people that aren't 16:23 doing so well but they'll be making the 16:25 twelve and a half and then they'll be 16:27 paying hopefully some pretty good tax 16:29 someday but with boredom all them the 16:31 personal taxes the corporate taxes we 16:34 brought the taxes down where trillions 16:36 of dollars is outside of our country 16:38 trillions and companies can't bring it 16:40 back because the taxes so high it 16:43 doesn't make sense plus bureaucratically 16:45 they can't do it 16:46 so what they do you know what they do 16:47 they leave the country to get their 16:49 money and they leave the country because 16:51 taxes are too high just about the 16:53 highest in the world are taxes and you 16:57 know with all those taxes our roads our 17:00 bed 17:00 everything's bad it's not like og we 17:03 have I taxes but everything is tippy-top 17:05 as we say it's the opposite of tippy top 17:08 you got potholes you got airports that a 17:10 horrible like third-world countries yet 17:14 bridges that I have falling down see the 17:16 safety records on the bridges so we are 17:19 going to get things straight down folks 17:21 so we're going to put people back to 17:22 work but we're going to put Americans 17:23 back to work 17:24 America 17:33 I'd like to move those legs over ok so I 17:37 bridge 17:51 I've been saying from the beginning that 17:55 this campaign and how ridiculous 17:58 everything is when you look at yes the 18:01 unfair tax system i've been talking 18:04 about how crazy the tax system is how 18:07 unfair it is how much tax we pay this is 18:10 not the fault 18:12 believe it or not of the RS but the 18:14 political class that is owned outright 18:17 by the special interests in the lobbies 18:19 they want something done they want a 18:21 provision put in they put it it's these 18:24 politicians who wrote and amend and tax 18:28 code really a tax code that really is a 18:32 disgrace to our country in so many ways 18:35 it's a favor to the donors it's a favor 18:38 to the special interests many so-called 18:42 experts they get tremendous fees to 18:45 understand what's going in 18:46 they have no idea of the size the 18:49 complexity of the code itself and 18:52 thousands and thousands of pages 18:53 represent unfairness the unfairness of 18:57 the tax laws is unbelievable 19:00 it's something that I've been talking 19:01 about for a long time you've heard me 19:03 talking about it 19:04 despite being a very big beneficiary 19:07 must admit I am i am i'm a big benefit 19:16 but you're more important than my being 19:18 a beneficiary so we're going to 19:20 straighten it out and make it fair for 19:21 everybody so awful i understand the tax 19:27 law is better than almost anyone which 19:30 is why i am the one who can fix them and 19:33 that is what I commit to you I will 19:42 as a business person I've legally use 19:44 the tax laws to benefit really a means 19:47 to my benefit and the benefit of my 19:50 company my investors my employees my 19:54 family thank you it as a major real 20:00 estate developer this country and 20:03 throughout the world i faced enormous 20:04 tax city tax estate taxes sales fences 20:08 excise taxes employee taxes federal 20:11 taxes that taxes in different countries 20:14 it's my job always to minimize the 20:18 overall taxpayer to the greatest extent 20:21 possible which allows me to reinvest in 20:24 neighborhood workers building amazing 20:27 structures all over the place and it 20:30 fuels the tremendous growth in various 20:34 communities throughout the United States 20:41 and by the way George Charles declared 20:44 1.5 billion 20:49 he declared 1.5 billion in losses in six 20:53 months and in 2014 warren buffett lost 20:56 873 million dollars i wonder if they 20:59 deducted that you think no I don't think 21:01 I don't think so why would they ever do 21:04 a thing like that what I think they 21:06 never do a thing like that i don't think 21:07 that's just the beginning i could give 21:10 you numbers that you wouldn't even 21:11 believe numbers far bigger than that 21:14 massive numbers and we are going to do 21:19 things to make our tax system fair and 21:22 make our whole country a more fair place 21:25 to live 21:30 the news media is now obsessed with an 21:35 alleged violence from the nineteen 21:37 nineties on time ago at the end of one 21:41 of the most brutal economic downturns in 21:44 our country's history the conditions 21:46 facing real estate developers in the 21:48 early nineties were almost as bad as the 21:50 great depression in 1929 and far worse 21:54 than the great recession in 2008 which 21:57 was nothing compared to the early 21:59 nineties what had been a booming economy 22:02 of the area of Ronald Reagan changed 22:05 dramatically in the business landscape 22:06 changed with it 22:08 bank failures that collapse of the 22:10 Savings and Loan industry the implosion 22:13 of the retail market real estate in 22:16 general was a disaster 22:18 many business people including many of 22:20 my competitors some of my friends were 22:23 not able to survive companies jobs 22:27 opportunities were lost and lives were 22:30 destroyed his tens of thousands of 22:32 people will put out of work that was a 22:34 rough . the roughest . i've ever seen 22:36 some people say in many respects it was 22:39 almost the equivalent of 1929 the 22:41 disaster yet today my company is bigger 22:44 stronger with far greater assets and 22:47 more premium properties than ever before 22:50 my company has never been stronger it's 22:52 never been better 22:54 it is one great company and I'm leaving 23:03 for this at all these years you're 23:06 building a company 23:07 somebody said you know he built this 23:08 great company some of the great 23:10 properties in the world and now when he 23:13 could be enjoying the fruits of his 23:15 labor 23:15 what's he doing I'm with you in a hot 23:19 arena making speeches 23:25 I'm with you an arena that's about 95 23:28 degrees because it wasn't supposed to 23:29 have this many people it wasn't designed 23:33 that supposed to be a hockey nice cool 23:38 space right or basketball or something 23:42 this is amazing but I love doing it and 23:45 I must tell you and I tell this often 23:48 people in this room in many cases were 23:52 making more money eighteen years ago 23:54 with one great job then they're making 23:56 today with two and three jobs 24:08 and the only thing i can tell you the 24:11 only thing i can tell you is they're 24:13 getting older and they're working harder 24:16 and they're making less it's not 24:18 supposed to be that way but you know 24:20 what i'm getting older and I'm working 24:23 harder right now that I've ever worked 24:25 in my life so we're all in the same ball 24:27 stolen this 24:32 i was able to use the tax laws of our 24:35 country and my skills as a 24:36 businessperson to dig out of this real 24:39 estate depression when few others were 24:42 able to do that in those most difficult 24:45 times when so many had their backs to 24:47 the wall i reached within myself and 24:50 delivered from my company my employees 24:52 my family and the communities where my 24:55 properties existed i did a great job 24:58 during the early nineties as companies 25:02 were collapsing one after another the 25:05 media and powers-that-be said Donald 25:08 Trump could never make it back remember 25:11 Don I don't have you remember some of it 25:13 is a long time ago that were bringing 25:16 this up is a little ridiculous but let's 25:18 do it anyway but they did they were so 25:21 happy just like they're miserable today 25:24 they said how did this happen with Trump 25:26 they said I had billions of dollars and 25:29 borrowed and hundreds of millions and 25:32 personal guarantee and no pathway out 25:35 and they were largely true except i 25:37 always felt I did have a bath but I 25:39 never had any doubts and I never ever 25:42 gave up like the people in this room we 25:44 never 25:51 that's because I knew in my heart that 25:53 when the chips were down is when I 25:56 perform the best it's what a lot of the 25:58 people in this room I other people in 25:59 this room I know who you are 26:02 I know your guts I know the people in 26:04 this room in the people in plenty of 26:06 other rooms where we go and break 26:07 records at every arena we go to the 26:12 reason I never felt in danger during the 26:15 real estate downturn and I never did was 26:18 that I knew myself I knew my business I 26:21 knew the financial system i knew the tax 26:23 code inside out and backwards and most 26:26 importantly I knew how to fight 26:36 and that's what I am and what you 26:38 are/were fighters and I'm now going to 26:41 fight for you were bringing our country 26:43 back 26:50 in the early nineties they splash the 26:53 front pages with stories about how 26:56 Donald Trump finally finally he's 26:59 finished you think they like me 27:02 I don't think so everybody said that I 27:05 was done there were front page articles 27:08 in The Wall Street Journal and The New 27:09 York Times they were thrilled and 27:12 delighted to write these negative 27:13 stories and they were negative so they 27:18 said I was finished the only person who 27:20 didn't think that I was in trouble was 27:24 Donald J Trump I didn't fix and you know 27:29 what my mother and father loved me 27:32 my brother's my sister's my best friends 27:35 they thought i was gonna do very well 27:37 but i will say we have to have 27:39 confidence in ourselves and a lot of 27:41 confidence that this was a bad / this 27:43 was really a depression a lot of the 27:45 folks in the room i'm just watching as 27:48 their wincing when I mentioned the dates 27:51 because those were bad times for a lot 27:52 of people including people here i 27:54 started my company with a small loan and 27:57 as I grew I borrowed money in order to 27:59 grow the company bought a lot from big 28:02 banks big institutions when the bottom 28:04 fell out of the real estate market 28:06 I had all the debt it stayed the same 28:08 but the value of the assets plummeted 28:11 interesting but I knew how to use the 28:14 tax code to rebuild my company when 28:16 others didn't have a clue 28:18 some of them come to see me today and 28:20 they say man I wish I saw you Donald and 28:23 they're wiped out my understanding of 28:25 the tax code gave me a big advantage 28:27 over those who didn't have a clue 28:29 including many of my competitors who 28:31 lost everything they had never to be 28:34 heard from again 28:35 now they're gone i'm here and i'm ready 28:41 to turn things around 28:43 for our 28:52 and the dishonest media's back there 28:54 then all can you believe we just we 28:57 can't get rid of this kind this guy is 28:58 brutal 29:04 this guy is brutal the early nineties 29:07 was a very tough time for the world but 29:09 in tough times you need very tough and 29:13 very smart people which is you 29:16 these are tough times for America today 29:18 and we need smart leaders these tough 29:22 times where when I performed my best and 29:26 enjoyed it in a certain way the most the 29:29 economy and the bank's collapsing the 29:31 government was a mess but i enjoyed 29:33 waking up every single morning to go to 29:36 battle and it was battle i enjoyed 29:39 getting up taking out the financial 29:42 establishment dealing with the financial 29:44 establishment somewhere friendly 29:46 somewhere great somewhere terrible but I 29:49 did it because I had to win i had to win 29:52 I know how to make a deal 29:55 I know how to make a comeback and that's 29:58 what it is again bigger better stronger 30:00 company by far than ever before that's 30:03 the thinking we need for our country 30:06 that's the thinking we need when we are 30:09 negotiating trade deals and military 30:11 skills and economic ills on behalf of 30:14 the American people that's what we need 30:32 put me into the boardroom as your 30:35 representative and I will deliver for 30:37 you like no politician has ever 30:40 delivered believe me 30:46 we're going to deliver we're going to 30:49 deliver we're going to get the best 30:50 people in the world you know we have the 30:52 greatest business people in the world we 30:54 don't use them we use political hacks to 30:56 negotiate trade deals and frankly it is 30:58 disgusting when you look at what's 31:01 happened to our country 31:02 Hillary Clinton is in it only for 31:04 herself and for her donors I'm here 31:07 fighting for America when the pressure 31:09 is on when the odds are stacked against 31:12 me when people say it can't be done 31:15 that's when we have to get started 31:22 the one thing that motivates me the most 31:25 is when people tell me and they tell the 31:29 united states that something is totally 31:32 impossible because believe me we have a 31:36 very tough situation right down for me 31:39 impossible is just a starting point from 31:42 the depths of that terrible real estate 31:44 depression i created a company worth 31:47 billions and billions of dollars and 31:49 created tens of thousands of jobs our 31:54 company and our employees remade 31:57 skylines revitalize neighborhoods 31:59 rejuven eyes communities and hire 32:03 thousands and thousands of american 32:06 workers on november eight America's 32:10 comeback begins and we are going to rise 32:13 up from our present challenge bigger and 32:16 better and stronger than ever before 32:35 those who spent their entire lives 32:37 within the confines of government work 32:39 and you know virtually nothing a 32:41 business fail to understand the skill 32:44 dedication and sheer grip it takes for a 32:47 company to climb out of an economic 32:50 depression of the scale we had in the 32:53 early nineties people like my opponent 32:56 crooked Hillary Clinton whose only 32:59 method of making money is by selling 33:01 government favors and granting access to 33:04 special interest know nothing about how 33:07 businesses succeed and grow all you have 33:11 to do is look at upstate New York and 33:14 the terrible job she did she said she 33:16 was gonna bring back jobs she never did 33:18 it was a disaster and it is to this day 33:21 Hillary Clinton has never created a 33:23 single job in her life or added a single 33:27 dollar value to the American economy 33:29 Hillary Clinton hasn't made an honest 33:33 dollar in her life 33:35 all she does is take from you take from 33:38 our country and pedals influence to 33:40 donors special interests and foreign 33:43 ackles for astronomical dollars frankly 33:48 like probably never before its 33:50 corruption of the highest order 33:53 well I made my money as a successful 33:57 private business person following the 34:00 law Hillary Clinton made her money as a 34:02 corrupt public official break-in the law 34:06 and putting our government offices for 34:09 sale 34:14 by her own account crooked Hillary left 34:18 the White House dead broke and now she 34:20 and her husband have made more than 200 34:23 million dollars without building a 34:25 company or creating a single thing of 34:27 value i left private business for public 34:31 life you believe I'm in public life can 34:33 you believe this am I a politician I 34:36 hope not because I understand our 34:40 countries in bad shape and needs to be 34:42 turned around fast we are 20 trillion 34:45 dollars in debt doubled under obama and 34:48 we run massive trade deficits on annual 34:51 basis almost 800 billion dollars in 34:55 trading with the world this you think of 34:58 it we had a trade deficit this year 35:00 almost 800 billion dollars 35:06 we have to Kang infrastructure failing 35:10 schools rising crime a depleted military 35:14 with the greatest people in the world 35:16 there but it's depleted in so many 35:18 different ways including its equipment 35:21 and open border and an economy that can 35:24 create full-time high-paying jobs we are 35:28 a divided nation and each week it seems 35:31 we're getting more and more divided with 35:33 race riots in our streets on a monthly 35:36 basis 35:37 this is not the America that was handed 35:40 down to us and it's not the America we 35:43 want given to our children 35:55 but this is the America we will have if 35:58 we don't change our leadership 36:01 immediately we need that change we need 36:03 that vote november eight the gotta get 36:06 out the film political establishment 36:12 Moscow it must go for the sake of your 36:15 country your future and those you love 36:19 the most like that little guy right 36:21 there right hold that baby of a so 36:25 beautiful so 36:35 and he likes it the people of Colorado 36:39 know what it takes to rebuild this 36:41 country this is this state with a rich 36:45 immigrant history and a rich Latinos 36:53 no you hell from all regions of the 36:56 world you are united by this one thing 36:59 you are all Americans and great america 37:07 and as America 37:10 you're entitled to the same protections 37:12 as every other American everyone 37:15 lawfully living inside of our borders is 37:17 entitled to the same things safe 37:20 communities a great education and access 37:23 to high paying wonderful jobs 37:29 this is the change that we will deliver 37:31 Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 37:35 years and delivered nothing but fan you 37:38 look at her record she's got experience 37:41 but it's bad experience her policies 37:44 have brought death and destruction 37:46 overseas and poverty at home she also 37:50 put a ran on the path the nuclear 37:52 weapons that was the beginning of her 37:54 deal 37:55 one of the worst deals anybody has ever 37:58 seen negotiated and on the path to a 38:02 massive infusion of cash and resources 38:05 including the lifting of sanctions on 38:08 banks used to finance the missile 38:10 program which is hard to believe in 38:12 America she brought enormous poverty to 38:15 all communities she brought it to the 38:17 communities and the inner cities like 38:20 you wouldn't believe but especially 38:22 african-american and Latino citizens she 38:26 turned applied I'd to rising crime and 38:29 has no solutions for the suffering 38:31 people of Chicago Baltimore and all over 38:34 the nation you see what's happening 38:36 Chicago thousands and thousands of 38:39 shootings since january first thousands 38:42 instead she attacks the police and by 38:46 the way I've gotten the endorsement from 38:48 virtually every 38:56 we need safety she opposes school choice 38:59 and wants to trap poor african-american 39:02 Latino children in failing government 39:05 schools because she wants the money from 39:07 the teachers union to keep pouring in 39:09 that's all it is Hillary Clinton 39:12 supports Obamacare and wants to expand 39:15 it Obamacare is an absolute disaster 39:21 we're premiums in Colorado are set to go 39:24 up by massive numbers and the only way 39:28 to stop this disaster is to vote for 39:30 Donald Trump that 39:40 Hillary Clinton also supports a terrible 39:44 trade deals like Bill Clinton's NAFTA 39:46 one of the worst deals ever made in the 39:48 history of tread and China's entry into 39:52 the World Trade Organization and next 39:54 she wants the trans-pacific partnership 39:56 the deal she calls the gold standard 39:58 which he lied about during the debate 40:01 and she said she'd never said that but 40:03 of course Lester Holt never questioned 40:05 her all he does is question be me 40:11 Colorado has lost more than one and 40:14 seven manufacturing jobs since the NAFTA 40:17 and China deals but what you've lost out 40:20 Hillary Clinton has raked in cash from 40:23 her contributors she had will have made 40:26 150 million dollars in speeches and 40:30 she's not a good speaker to basel to 40:34 special interests they gave 39 speeches 40:38 to big banks including two million 40:40 dollars in speaking fees from goldman 40:42 sachs i would like to see what the 40:44 speeches said she doesn't want to 40:46 release them release the papers Hillary 40:48 released us back and never forgot 40:51 Hillary's deal that allowed Russia to 40:55 get twenty percent of america's uranium 40:58 and it cost them dearly 41:02 they got a lot of money for that one to 41:05 hide her corruption Hillary Clinton put 41:07 our emails on an illegal server a secret 41:10 server think of it open to foreign 41:13 hacking then she deleted and bleach and 41:16 nobody bleaches because it's such an 41:19 expensive process he just don't do it 41:21 most people even sophisticated people 41:24 never even heard of it she bleached and 41:26 deleted 33,000 emails after a 41:30 congressional subpoena so think of this 41:32 she gets subpoena and after she gets the 41:36 subpoena she deletes all over emails 41:41 Wow 41:56 she lied to congress under oath and her 41:59 staff is took the fifth you remember 42:02 that so many people took the Fifth 42:04 Amendment there was nobody left 42:07 they all got immunity deals they all got 42:10 immunity mean what is your 5 there was 42:15 nobody else they could go after they all 42:17 had immunity they shouldn't have wasted 42:20 their time if they're gonna give him 42:21 immunity what are you wasting your time 42:23 for it's worse than watergate it's a 42:26 bigger deal than Watergate but 42:29 unfortunately the media doesn't want to 42:31 follow it 42:36 the investigation of Hillary Clinton was 42:40 rigged 42:42 it's a shame and I must tell you it's 42:47 one of the saddest things that many of 42:51 us have ever witnessed in this country 42:55 we become a banana republic and today we 43:01 learned that the FBI made a side deal 43:03 with lettuce top aides to destroy their 43:06 laptops i said it's okay to show you 43:07 left us get rid of him 43:11 what is going on right what is going on 43:15 clinton is the ringleader of a criminal 43:18 enterprise that is corrupted our 43:20 government at the highest levels and the 43:24 American people have one chance to stop 43:26 it and that is with their vote people 43:32 have had people have at it with the 43:38 years the decades of clinton corruption 43:41 remember impeached for lying can't 43:44 practice law 43:46 I mean what are we doing folks why don't 43:49 we don't 43:50 although the good news it seems like 43:53 we're up in Colorado that's good and 43:55 we're up in Ohio and we're up in North 43:58 Carolina 44:02 and we're up in Florida where up and a 44:04 lot of places and they're spending in 44:08 some cases fifty-to-one adds adds 50 to 44:12 1 so how can you be tied or up when she 44:15 had the answer so false as some of our 44:18 little bit troubling but it's so false 44:22 this will be the year the american 44:24 people say enough is enough 44:32 now another issue that we want to 44:35 address today is immigration colorado is 44:39 home to many wonderful hard-working 44:43 immigrants and it's these hard-working 44:48 immigrants who stand to lose the most 44:51 from our open borders and are open 44:54 immigration policy illegal immigration 44:58 and broken visa programs take jobs 45:01 directly from Latino workers living 45:04 lawfully in Colorado and any States many 45:07 states today it's also taking jobs from 45:13 african-americans who want so much to 45:16 have those jobs illegal immigration also 45:19 brings with it massive crime and massive 45:22 drugs including a terrible heroin 45:25 problem right here in Colorado you have 45:27 a tremendous problem everybody's telling 45:29 me about it but many of the states have 45:32 that problem we are going to build a 45:35 wall 45:58 and we're going to stop the drugs their 46:01 gangs and violence from pouring into 46:04 Colorado and from pouring into our 46:07 country 46:11 we're going to shut down the sanctuary 46:14 cities that have led the preventable 46:17 deaths of so so many 46:23 cases like Kate styling murdered in san 46:26 francisco by a five-time deported 46:29 illegal immigrant or cases like Sarah 46:33 route killed by an illegal immigrant 46:35 release at the border by President Obama 46:37 and then released again after the 46:41 killing 46:43 my friend Jimmy o Shah who lost his 46:46 incredible son talented son beautiful 46:49 son lost to an illegal immigrant that 46:53 should have been here for cases like 46:55 Maryland Ferris Maryland was a 64-year 46:59 old Air Force veteran who was sexually 47:02 assaulted and beaten to death with a 47:04 hammer her killer and illegal immigrant 47:07 had been arrested on multiple occasions 47:09 but was never ever reported there are 47:14 over two million 47:17 two million criminal aliens in this 47:20 country and we are going to get them out 47:23 of our country and we are going to get 47:26 them out 47:34 to the cartels to the gang to the drug 47:37 dealers I have a simple message for you 47:40 your days are numbered and your reign of 47:43 crime will soon be coming to a very very 47:46 crashing and 47:53 with that being said we also have to 47:55 keep our country safe from terrorism the 47:58 terrorists who planted the bombs in new 48:01 york and new jersey just last week and 48:04 who carried out the mall stabbing in 48:05 Minnesota were foreign nationals 48:08 admitted into our country as was the 48:12 mall shooter in Washington or look at 48:15 cases like the Boston bombers you 48:18 remember them here on asylum or the San 48:22 Bernardino shooter here on a fiance visa 48:25 sense so nice sounds so nice 48:28 Beyonce reason our people didn't know 48:30 what they were doing and frankly they 48:32 should have checked her facebook page 48:34 and they would have never let her into 48:36 this country killed 14 people people 48:40 that gave them a party for their baby 48:43 kill them many many wounded will never 48:48 be able to recover fully or the Orlando 48:52 shooter the son of a Taliban supporter 48:54 from Afghanistan terrorists are 48:57 infiltrating our country now Hillary 49:00 Clinton wants a five hundred and fifty 49:02 percent increase in Syrian refugees and 49:05 countless more refugees from across the 49:09 Middle East 49:11 I want to keep you and your family safe 49:14 and we were 49:22 and we'll bill safe zones in Syria and 49:26 we'll get the Gulf states to pay for 49:28 them not us 49:32 but we have to keep our country safe 49:34 because what's happening from within 49:37 this could be the great Trojan horse of 49:39 all time folks 49:41 my job is not to represent foreign 49:44 countries 49:45 my job is to represent the citizens of 49:48 the United States of America 49:54 putting your jobs your wages and you 49:57 security first if you're living in the 50:01 United States today as a lawful resident 50:03 or US citizen i will ensure you have a 50:07 safe community rising wages and an 50:09 immigration system that protects your 50:12 jobs 50:15 we're not going to let our company's go 50:17 to Mexico and other places make the same 50:20 product fire all of their employees and 50:23 think they're gonna sell that product 50:25 across are now very strong border and 50:28 there won't be retribution 50:29 now there will be retribution there will 50:31 be consequences and the consequence will 50:34 be that they will pay a 35-percent tax 50:37 every time they make something and want 50:39 to sell it back into the United States 50:45 and when that happens they're not going 50:49 to move very simple they're going to say 50:51 wow our formulas don't work so well 50:54 anymore but the politicians don't want 50:57 that because they're taken care of by 50:58 people that on these companies ok me i 51:01 don't care i put up a fortune for my 51:03 campaign and I don't know 51:11 here's some more things we will do 51:14 starting in 2017 we are going to lower 51:17 your taxes massively Hillary is going to 51:22 increase your classes 51:23 we're going to eliminate every 51:25 unnecessary regulation she's going to 51:27 increase regulation we're going to end 51:31

Constitution 52:19 of the United 52:25 we are going to rebuild America we are 52:29 going to revitalize America we are going 52:33 to unite America again 52:40 imagine what our country could 52:42
