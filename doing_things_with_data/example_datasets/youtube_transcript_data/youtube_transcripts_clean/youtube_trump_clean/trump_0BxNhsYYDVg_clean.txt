have meetings with people and they kept 6:43 talking about heroin heroin heroin I 6:45 tell the story all over New Hampshire 6:47 because it's so different than these 6:48 beautiful little valleys and the trees 6:51 and the lakes and beautiful roads that 6:53 we just rolled over and you talk about 6:55 heroin and it doesn't work it just sort 6:57 of doesn't seem right but it's a 6:59 tremendous problem here and it's a 7:01 tremendous problem all over the country 7:02 and we're gonna close up that border 7:04 we're going to build a wall you know we 7:05 got the ice endorsement just yesterday 7:07 ice great people and we got the Border 7:14 Patrol endorsement and the border patrol 7:17 agents endorses 16,500 and sheriff joe 7:20 endorsed Sheriff John top sheriff joe is 7:24 tough and good

to keep this small and by the way they 7:37 were saying this is practice for sunday 7:39 this isn't right this has nothing to do 7:40 with something which is here because we 7:42 just wanted to be here and you know 7:45 Hilary frankly they talk about debate 7:48 prep this that debate prep she's resting 7:51 she's rested and I want to be with the 7:54 American people I want to be with the 7:56 people from New Hampshire and she wants 7:58 to the big book 8:01 tonight we'll discuss many issues of 8:07 great importance to New Hampshire and 8:10 few states in America been hurt worse by 8:13 the trade policies of my opponent and 8:16 you know that NAFTA has been a disaster 8:17 signed by her husband and you've lost 8:21 nearly one in three jobs think of that I 8:23 mean think of it one in three jobs since 8:26 NAFTA and China make deals we made deals 8:29 with China World Trade Organization what 8:33 a disaster that was supported by Hillary 8:36 Clinton but then after deal signed by 8:38 her husband 8:39 although we did a great thing two days 8:42 ago when he was willing to say how bad 8:44 Obamacare was ours pray that was pretty 8:48 good 8:48 the open border policies and i just 8:53 wrote this out but I feel so important 8:55 the open border policies of Hillary 8:58 Clinton including catch-and-release 9:00 another terrible practice have allowed a 9:03 massive influx of drugs into New 9:06 Hampshire and frankly in two states all 9:09 over our country almost every state and 9:13 its really fueled the tremendous heroin 9:16 and drug crisis that we have within a 9:18 close up those borders folks believe me 9:20 and I promised that to you in New 9:22 Hampshire more than anything else I said 9:24 and I talked about it no matter where I 9:26 go and I mentioned this state because it 9:29 was really the first glimpse i gotta 9:31 have serious the problem we have their 9:33 poisoning our youth they're poisoning 9:34 more than are you there poisoning 9:37 everybody but they're poisoning our 9:39 youth stuff enough out there are youth 9:42 doesn't have a chance with what's 9:44 happening and we're not going to let it 9:45 happen anymore and we're going to help 9:46 the people that are so badly addicted 9:49 we're gonna help 9:51 so I'm gonna bring your jobs back 9:57 jobs are leaving like you never saw 9:59 before record levels i'm going to stop 10:02 the drugs from coming in i'm going to 10:05 create school choice and we're going to 10:07 get rid of common core which is a 10:09 disaster and we're going to create 10:15 something very special for every 10:18 disadvantaged child in this country of 10:23 which we have far too many we're going 10:26 to repeal and replace Obamacare which 10:31 bill admitted this week is a crazy 10:37 system can you believe 10:39 hey least he's honest boy has he 10:42 suffered can you imagine can you imagine 10:44 that that has he has he suffered but he 10:50 said it's a crazy system that doesn't 10:52 make sense and doesn't work and where 10:56 people end up with premiums doubled and 10:59 coverage cut in half I couldn't have 11:02 said it better myself I've been saying 11:03 it 11:04 hey I've been saying it for two years 11:05 longer i know i'm gonna put him on the 11:08 campaign 11:09 oh I'm sure they do you think anybody's 11:11 called him and said let's recheck he did 11:14 a minor retraction but you can see he 11:15 wasn't happy about it 11:17 remember jonathan gruber do we remember 11:19 the name I don't ever forget 11:21 Jonathan group of the architect of the 11:23 bill admitted it was sold on lies 11:26 remember that sold he thought he was 11:28 talking to his friend unfortunately 11:29 expended turned out not to be such a 11:31 good friend because his friend had a 11:33 little cell phone going their cellphones 11:35 a brew just like emails a brutal unless 11:39 you want to delete them all 11:40 unless you delete about 33,000 but 11:48 Jonathan Gruber the architect of 11:50 Obamacare admitted it was sold on lies 11:52 and talked about the stupidity of the 11:56 American voter right remember that the 11:59 stupidity of the American voter the only 12:01 stupidity was that the politicians who 12:04 ignored the American people and force 12:06 this thing absolutely forced it down 12:07 their throat and Hillary Clinton wants 12:11 to double down she wants to make it even 12:15 worse I mean that's ultimately what's 12:16 going to happen in me you've seen what 12:19 we're going to do you have much much 12:22 better healthcare at a much lower price 12:24 and people are gonna be very happy 12:26 extremely happy and we're going to take 12:29 care of those that are disadvantaged 12:31 can't afford to do what others can't 12:33 afford to do but you're gonna be 12:35 spending and we're going to take care of 12:36 them better than there being taken care 12:38 of now but you're going to have health 12:41 care that works you're going to have 12:43 health care where companies compete to 12:45 get your business and I'll come up with 12:47 plans that you haven't even seen or 12:49 thought about right now it'll be a 12:50 beautiful thing to see and I'm sure 12:53 we'll be talking about it on sunday 12:55 night during the debate because there's 12:57 no way we'll lose this issue to disaster 13:00 Obamacare is it 13:04 we're going to create a more honest 13:06 government our government is a disaster 13:08 how about the 1.7 billion in cash that 13:11 was given to a ranch cash remember was 13:13 gonna be 400 million turned out to be 13:15 1.7 billion and carries you know what 13:17 that is that's more than this room 13:19 that's you would put it probably in 13:21 hundreds all those all different 13:23 currencies from different nationalities 13:24 maybe they didn't want american dollars 13:27 they said anybody so stupid to make a 13:31 deal like this we don't want their money 13:32 but can you imagine this these people 13:36 they never saw anything like it 13:39 and by the way that's not going to fight 13:40 terror got plenty of money that they're 13:42 using the fight that's going to this 13:43 Swiss bank accounts ok just in case you 13:45 have any questions re anywhere we gave 13:48 it to him and boarded we give it to him 13:50 so I want to let you know that we are 13:53 going to be a country that's going to be 13:56 run properly and I'm gonna be by the 13:58 time this finishes i'll be in for 14:01 tremendous amounts of money tremendous 14:02 amounts of money that i find myself 14:06 we also have a lot of wonderful people 14:09 in terms of small donations and that's 14:12 coming in fantastically and we have some 14:14 people that just feel very good about 14:16 our country under proper leadership but 14:19 we're spending a lot of money and we're 14:22 doing it ourselves and we're very proud 14:23 of it we're gonna be very proud of our 14:25 country and what people call up to ask 14:26 for certain favors that are bad for the 14:29 country but good for them the nice but I 14:31 don't even have to take their phone call 14:33 I don't need them 14:35 I don't have to take this 14:36 before we go any further I want to send 14:42 our thoughts our hearts are with all of 14:45 the people and prayers to the millions 14:48 in the path of what's now known as 14:51 hurricane Matthew it looks like it's a 14:54 big one and it's going to be a bad one 14:56 it looks like hopefully it takes that 14:58 right turn but it looks like it's going 15:00 in the opposite direction not good 15:02 there's one of the stronger storms to 15:04 hit in many decades and our neighbors in 15:07 florida georgia and the carolinas are in 15:10 a direct path that seems southeast 15:14 florida has taken the brunt we have a 15:16 lot of friends in Florida a lot of a lot 15:19 of buildings a lot of investments in 15:21 Florida lot of great employees in 15:22 florida southeast florida is taking the 15:24 brunt of the storm to all of my friends 15:27 in Florida please know that we are 15:29 praying for you and everyone in their 15:32 the path you've got to take care of 15:34 yourself 15:36 you've got to get out of the area you've 15:37 got to listen you have a great governor 15:38 Governor Scott and you gotta listen 15:42 because it could be a it could be a 15:44 really really bad one so it's gonna be a 15:47 rough couple of days and maybe beyond 15:50 that but we'll see what the path 15:51 ultimately is we've seen the damage 15:53 throughout the Caribbean and Cuba the 15:56 Bahamas Haiti and others in fact they 15:59 say in Haiti almost 270 people they 16:02 think around 270 people have already 16:05 been killed by this terrible stone so to 16:10 the folks in haiti and all over we're 16:13 going to be helping you will be with you 16:16 and we send our best wishes and prayers 16:18 we have a tremendous problem that i 16:23 think is brewing right now as we speak 16:25 here so we'll know in about 45 hours i 16:27 just spoke to rick scott and Governor 16:31 Christie just spoke to rick scott and it 16:33 looks like four or five hours away so 16:35 we'll we'll know but whatever happens 16:38 we're with everybody because it is it 16:42 looks like it's going to be a very bad 16:43 when maybe the worst in a long period of 16:45 time 16:45 okay with that Howie Carr has been 16:49 amazing he's been very I don't know if 16:52 he's allowed to support but he sounds 16:53 like he supports me a lot i'm not sure 16:57 that he's allowed to 17:01 I'm not sure he's allowed to but i think 17:04 probably but he certainly been amazing 17:07 and he's very talented guy he's a 17:09 terrific guy with a terrific family so 17:11 when we came up with a lot of people 17:12 wanted us to do this we said let's get 17:14 Howie so how I let's go 17:16 you have some questions i do and i have 17:19 a clock down on the floor there that 17:21 says two minutes okay now do you want me 17:24 to call you when it goes over two 17:26 minutes like a ok what I make it if i'm 17:28 doing well don't come if I'm answering 17:33 the question poorly 17:34 please call me immediately affect you 17:36 could go okay you could go in 30 seconds 17:38 you could do it alright alright alright 17:40 alright thank God ok the first question 17:43 some of these are I have the names and 17:45 if i have the name i'll just ask the 17:46 person to stand up 17:48 this is a Matthew in bedford new 17:50 hampshire matthew is equally as Matthew 17:52 Matthew here I Matthew hi Matthew okay 17:56 Matthew says after the first debate the 17:58 media and even some of within the party 18:01 suggested that you should have gone 18:02 after Hillary more did you hold back and 18:05 do you plan on criticizing her more this 18:07 weekend 18:08 yeah I did hold back i thought it was 18:10 just inappropriate to say what I was 18:12 really thinking i would say and I held 18:14 back i think for I think for good reason 18:16 I think for good reason i'd much rather 18:18 have it be on policy and I didn't like 18:22 getting into the into the gutter and so 18:26 I did go back i also i mean honestly 18:28 this was you know the Commission the 18:30 so-called commission on presidential 18:32 debates 18:33 give me a break did you see where they 18:34 came from one of them comes from the 18:36 Hillary camp they had person was your 18:38 microphone work with this microphone is 18:40 wonderful but I had a problem with a mic 18:43 we had a guy inside the room oscillating 18:45 Michael isn't that the mic didn't work 18:46 and you know it's interesting i went 18:48 there a little bit before and I support 18:51 the mic is so great 18:52 unfortunately when I went to talk they 18:55 turn the mic up and down and you saw 18:57 everybody in the room so so we had a 18:59 real problem 19:00 and the head of the debate said you're 19:02 right it was a serious problem told us 19:04 to marry Julie any it was a serious 19:06 problem after the debate an 19:09 hour-and-a-half he said and now that the 19:11 debates over i'm going back stage to 19:13 find out what was wrong i said oh great 19:15 that him but i felt that i really felt 19:19 that I wanted to keep it on a higher 19:21 level is possible to see what happens 19:23 I mean let's see what happens i think 19:24 we're all better off if we can do that 19:25 because it is about issues it is about 19:28 policy so you kept in a minute 20 good 19:35 what do you see is the biggest foreign 19:38 policy failures of the last 15 years 19:41 well we have about what 24 hours to talk 19:45 about this 19:45 look we've had failures at every level 19:47 we've had failures i think the Randalls 19:50 one of the worst things I've ever seen 19:51 ok it's gonna lead to nuclear weapons i 19:54 was with bibi netanyahu the other day 19:57 and we talked and we talked about it and 20:00 not to reveal what he said but i will 20:01 tell you i can tell you what i said this 20:03 is horrible for Israel is horrible for 20:05 our country 20:06 it's a horrible deal because over a 20:09 period of time over a short period of 20:11 time it leads to within 10 years and 20:12 it's gonna be sooner than they gonna end 20:14 up with nuclear weapons and they have 20:15 like a path on top of it we gave them 20:18 back a hundred and fifty billion dollars 20:20 we obviously paid ransom for our 20:23 hostages 20:24 obviously you know obama says this had 20:25 nothing to do well why did they delay it 20:27 until all this money came in but most 20:32 importantly just to pay a deal and i'm 20:34 all for deals because I happen to think 20:36 that nuclear is just about the biggest 20:37 problem that we have in the world today 20:39 i think it's one of you know Obama 20:41 thinks its global warming i think its 20:43 nuclear and in the hands of the wrong 20:46 players this is devastating there's no 20:48 winner 20:49 there's never gonna be a winner with 20:50 nuclear believe me and so I think deals 20:53 like fine but they have to be good deals 20:54 the deal made by secretary Kerry never 20:57 left the table he just agreed agreed 21:00 agreed had want something that's a no 21:02 and he'd agree so said but there's one 21:06 example of a just horrible horrible 21:09 thing we should have never gone into 21:10 Iraq should never gone into Iraq 21:13 but of equal importance or almost equal 21:16 importance is the way we got out 21:18 Obama took us out with Hillary Clinton 21:20 create this incredible vacuum Isis was 21:23 formed a lot of different problems 21:25 happened and totally disabled list you 21:30 know the surge whether you are in favor 21:32 of going in or not the surge really did 21:34 work then all of a sudden boom 21:36 not only that we announce always we're 21:38 leaving here we're leaving then what 21:40 about muscle did you see muscle where 21:42 they announced yesterday I'm seeing all 21:44 about whether to attack muscle we're 21:46 going to attack muscle 21:48 I mean why do they say that now a lot of 21:51 the bedroom browser and muscle the 21:53 leaders of Isis they think but they're 21:55 not there anymore because they say we're 21:57 going to attack let's go someplace else 21:58 isn't there an element of surprise 22:01 remember when we were young and we're 22:03 studying history and they talk about 22:04 some of the great generals and the great 22:06 attacks and was called the element of 22:08 surprise would it be nice if we attacked 22:11 first and talked about our great victory 22:13 later now are you are seriously who's 22:17 gonna 22:22 it's almost like they're wasting their 22:24 time attacking Muslim because everyone 22:25 that we want is gonna be gone 22:27 you have all civilians and they'll be 22:29 tremendous death and carnage but the 22:32 people that we want they're gonna say 22:33 hey which are the leaders get the hell 22:36 out of here 22:36 it's a very very sad thing we are being 22:39 run by people that are incompetent i 22:42 will tell you that this is charlene from 22:49 San working around she here Charlene 22:52 Charlie I know how are you 22:54 Charlene says mr. Trump I'm an 22:57 eighth-generation American of Hispanic 22:59 descent i live in new hampshire in 23:00 California you have my vote 23:03 I want to help other Hispanic see the 23:05 truth that she talks about how would the 23:07 current administration is the border 23:09 security sanctuary cities are increasing 23:11 drugs and crime she says Charlene says 23:14 what would you say to convince Hispanics 23:16 who are deceived by barack obama hillary 23:19 clinton and the biased media to vote for 23:21 you 23:22 well first of all thank you very much 23:23 and I appreciate it interestingly i was 23:25 listening the other day there was a 23:27 gentleman who owns a big radio station 23:29 Hispanic mostly all hispanic colors and 23:32 he was arguing with one of the house he 23:34 said no you don't notice in the people 23:36 that are calling in Hispanics they love 23:38 Trump they're all for Trump and he said 23:40 I was even surprised but now I'm for 23:42 Trump also you know I mean this is 23:43 happening more and more i just got back 23:46 from Las Vegas what we gave a tremendous 23:48 and we had a tremendous crowd of people 23:51 a lot of Hispanics Latinos they like to 23:54 be called in that area you know that 23:56 right 23:56 hispanics and latinos but we had 23:58 tremendous response and just tremendous 24:01 was an outpouring of love amazing and 24:04 you know people that are here legally 24:06 they don't want people coming across the 24:08 border illegally taking their jobs 24:09 taking their homes taking whatever they 24:12 want to take and we want people to come 24:14 in our I want people to come into our 24:16 country so bad but they have to come in 24:17 Legally you know we have a country and 24:19 we have laws we have a border and if you 24:21 don't have a border you don't have a 24:22 country but i think the biggest surprise 24:25 to big surprises we're gonna do great 24:26 with african-americans you look at 24:28 what's happening with the inner cities 24:29 it's a disgrace and the Democrats have 24:33 been running them for 24:34 up to a hundred years unbroken and the 24:36 african americans believe me I think 24:39 we're doing and you see how that the 24:41 numbers are changing one thing they 24:43 don't have a lot of confidence in 24:44 Hillary Clinton she's lied to him for 24:46 years she never pushy doesn't produce 24:48 she does she just doesn't produce but I 24:50 think we're going to do great with the 24:52 african-americans you look at the 24:53 poverty and the inner cities you look at 24:55 the crime in the inner cities you look 24:56 at the education and there's no jobs and 24:58 we're gonna do fantastic with Hispanics 25:00 I believe it Wow doing while keeping it 25:08 down right yeah Karen Whittaker from 25:11 send down here in sandown Karen I Karen 25:14 no thank you thank you i like this 25:18 audience i like this study how do you 25:20 define the income range for middle-class 25:22 it cannot be based on where you live 25:25 because the US tax codes do not 25:27 discriminate based on geography will 25:30 look out the way I look at it the middle 25:32 class has been forgotten in this country 25:34 taxes are too high jobs have been taken 25:37 away from you are a lot of our company's 25:40 lot of great companies have left our 25:42 country they've gone to Mexico and other 25:44 places china is making so much of our 25:46 product we don't make product anymore 25:48 anywhere near like we used to and i will 25:51 tell you such a great question because 25:52 our middle class has been treated so 25:55 badly by the politicians mean it's like 25:57 forgotten and we're lowering taxes as 26:00 you know way down for the middle class 26:02 we're changing the text structure 26:04 completely we had seven brackets now we 26:08 have three and we'll bring it down 26:10 actually for those making not a lot its 26:12 0 and we don't want them to send him 26:14 because that's huge bureaucratically and 26:16 extremely costly but we're bringing the 26:19 rates down to numbers that are much 26:21 lower you've seen the numbers much lower 26:23 and you're going to have a much lower 26:26 tax base Hillary Clinton's raising your 26:28 taxes way up 26:29 I don't even know what she's thinking 26:30 she's rate we're already the highest tax 26:33 nation in the world just about they can 26:35 maybe find every once in a while they're 26:37 still there fact-check we will know 26:38 there is a nation that you never heard 26:40 of where it slightly higher we are just 26:43 about industrial of the industrialized 26:45 nations with the highest 26:47 taxpayers in the world with the highest 26:49 tax nation in the world our business 26:51 taxes are going to be brought from 35% 26:54 to fifteen percent were cutting 26:56 regulations which are absolutely we want 26:59 regulation for environmental we want 27:01 regulation for safety but the 27:04 regulations are massive help their 27:06 massive and we're cutting the 27:08 regulations at a tremendous clip and i 27:11 would say seventy percent of the 27:13 regulations can go it's it's just 27:15 stopping businesses from growing and I 27:19 think you're going to see a tremendous 27:20 change in this country we're going to 27:22 see jobs come back we're going to see 27:24 companies come back into our country and 27:26 right now they're just leaving it's a 27:27 one-way street out we have a one-way 27:30 street right out of the country and 27:32 they're going largely to Mexico and 27:34 other places but Mexico is the eighth 27:37 wonder of the world 27:38 I tell the story a lot i have a friend 27:39 who builds plants and he pulls these 27:42 massive plants and he says done you have 27:43 to see what's going on in Mexico said 27:45 how about our country he goes not so 27:47 much 27:48 we're gonna switch that around a little 27:49 bit and we'll get along great with 27:51 mexico by the way but we've gotta switch 27:53 that around it's been a one-way highway 27:55 out of the United States is kappa see in 27:59 londonderry here kappa c kappa i 28:04 recently graduated magna cum laude with 28:06 a BS in chemistry and I'm having a lot 28:08 of trouble finding a job 28:10 what's your plan to bring jobs back to 28:12 America well that's the biggest problem 28:13 and that takes place with so many and 28:16 and even though it's over a hundred 28:18 degrees in this room don't feel but you 28:20 know this room was not meant for this 28:21 many people you do know that you're here 28:24 the other night I was making a speech 28:25 and we had tremendous massive crowds and 28:29 it was really hot so I'm a little warm 28:31 and there might have been a little bit 28:33 of sweat and one of these dishonest 28:35 people said Donald Trump was sweating 28:38 tonight said sweating is a hundred 28:40 degrees 28:41 and guess what we're all sweating 28:43 tonight also right that's ok that's good 28:46 that's healthy 28:47 the biggest problem you have is people 28:50 go to college 28:52 I mean that's great getting out magnet 28:54 that's fantastic that means real smart 28:56 but people go to college they work they 28:58 borrow money they're up to hear they're 29:00 up to their their neck in debt and then 29:03 they get out they can't get a job 29:05 I mean it's such a massive problem they 29:08 can't get a job because are really good 29:11 jobs are gone and they've gone to other 29:13 countries and so many other countries 29:15 are making a product I want to see the 29:17 day when you could get those great marks 29:20 and that incredible profession which you 29:23 love probably are you wouldn't have been 29:25 so high up in the class right at the top 29:27 but I want to see the day when we can 29:30 have those jobs back in this country at 29:32 the highest level 29:33 I want to see the day when Apple will 29:36 make their iphones in this country 29:37 instead of making them in china and 29:39 vietnam and all over the place okay 29:42 and believe me if I'm president that's 29:44 gonna happen and I used apple as an 29:46 example but in all fairness apple makes 29:48 all its products all over the place 29:49 they're not making them here mostly in 29:51 china now Vietnam which is becoming very 29:53 strong for this they're gonna stop 29:56 making them here going to stop making 29:58 here we have the people we have the most 29:59 unbelievable people if I learned one 30:01 thing and going around because we 30:03 started on jun 16 $MONTH of last year 30:05 and I've got to know the people and we 30:08 have by far the biggest rallies that 30:10 people have seen far bigger than Bernie 30:12 and he was second but far bigger now 30:14 Bernie's aren't so big by the way 30:15 they're very small Bernie made a big 30:18 mistake by the way Bernie Bernie Sanders 30:21 would have been legendary if he didn't 30:24 make a deal with the devil when he made 30:26 that deal his stock went way down it 30:29 went way down 30:30 I mean honestly even as somebody that is 30:32 you know disagrees with him on a lot of 30:34 things other than trade we're very much 30:36 on trade very very much entry except 30:39 i'll do things about it because I like 30:41 free trade but I want to make great deal 30:43 free trade but he was right on trade 30:45 because our country is being ripped off 30:47 with jobs and everything but we're gonna 30:49 have a country that makes product again 30:51 we're gonna have a country that apple 30:54 and these other 30:55 great companies are going to make their 30:58 product in our country and we're gonna 31:00 have lots of people working including 31:02 yourself we have to do that 31:03 okay thank you 31:08 is Bob Swanson hear Bob's Watson I bob 31:13 is one of my favorite questions when you 31:16 become president and you can you assure 31:19 the American people that you're going to 31:21 clean house from the top at the FBI the 31:26 Department State Department and the VA 31:28 and in what order when you start well I 31:34 guess we'll be talking about this for a 31:35 while to come but i have to tell you 31:37 it's one of the saddest things I've ever 31:40 seen happen to our country 31:43 what's happened with Hillary Clinton 31:46 where you send emails where they send a 31:50 subpoena and they want all of your 31:53 emails i mean if you're in private 31:54 business and you do what she did 31:56 it's called the whose gal okay they the 32:01 United States Congress Congress sends a 32:04 subpoena wanting emails and she gets the 32:08 subpoena and she deletes 33,000 emails 32:11 ended many other things including lying 32:14 all over the place and you see people 32:17 who have suffered greatly polluting 32:19 General Petraeus for doing a tiny 32:22 fraction of what you did that's only 32:23 because we're not going to we can't stay 32:25 here all night and talk about but the 32:26 lies she told the Congress the life she 32:28 told to the people but the life she told 32:30 to Congress and then you see an FBI give 32:36 her a know tape know anything 32:41 no swearing in i believe they said no 32:43 swearing you don't to even swear in and 32:46 they questioned her on the fourth of 32:47 July and then they really start finding 32:51 on labor day on right before labor day 32:54 when everyone's gone and god they got 32:56 here they got there I think what's 32:58 happened with respect to because I have 33:02 such respect for the people in the FBI 33:03 and have such incredible respect for the 33:05 FBI 33:06 what's happened to the FBI 33:08 into the justice department at the 33:10 highest level 33:11 honestly I think it's one of the saddest 33:13 things I've ever seen in this country it 33:15 whether we like it or don't like it to 33:18 look at what's happened and to look at 33:20 the way that's been handled and you know 33:23 every time I speak this is mentioned the 33:25 subject that people are going crazy the 33:28 people of this country are very very 33:30 angry very very angry and I i would 33:33 think I don't know this but i would 33:36 think that some of these great FBI 33:39 agents and the people that work within 33:41 the FBI i would imagine they are just 33:43 furious 33:45 that's what's happened to the reputation 33:47 of the FBI so I mean I think it's an 33:49 amazing question honestly it's like 33:52 we're third world country it's one of 33:54 the saddest things that I've ever seen 33:57 happen in this country and it happened 33:59 to justice and that's probably I guess 34:02 the way you feel also right it's very 34:05 said we also quick follow-up what would 34:07 you do with call me I just very 34:10 disappointed 34:11 I mean you know when he read the charges 34:14 and he's going to 1234 and I'm saying 34:20 wow they're going to do the right thing 34:23 and and he goes essentially however it 34:28 was I mean it was amazing it was amazing 34:31 to go after . after . that was only a 34:33 few of them so it's very disappointing 34:37 it's very disappointing 34:41 Sharon Osbourne from auburn Sharon 34:47 challenge for the conservative holdouts 34:50 mr. Trump or not on the Trump bandwagon 34:52 yet what can you say to convince them 34:54 that your support for traditional 34:56 conservative issues of free markets the 34:58 Bill of Rights and the rest of the 34:59 Constitution mean they should endorse 35:01 you 35:01 well you know we don't have too many 35:02 Howie I'll be honest with you know the 35:04 press likes to report you have some of 35:06 these long-term people that have done 35:09 such a bad job you look at the look at 35:11 the problem or countries in I would 35:13 never use these people and they know 35:14 that so then you would they announce in 35:16 a group that they going over Hillary 35:18 right you understand and they announced 35:20 that the group but you know we have 35:22 tremendous support including a couple of 35:25 your very distinguished folks from New 35:26 Hampshire who were against me who are 35:30 now for me and you're allowed to 35:31 announce the names but we have 35:33 tremendous support in New Hampshire one 35:36 of them was very tough and very smart go 35:39 ahead 35:39 Johnson oh that's show I'd watch your 35:42 mouth boy let's stop it son is four 35:45 points up god that's good 35:47 well that's good because I'm up i mean 35:49 i-i thought it was terrific i met him 35:51 the other day and father answer and i 35:55 think i think they're great people but 35:57 he was tough 35:59 I'll tell you what he was he was really 36:02 hunting for Trump and you know what I 36:05 respect somebody that can go the other 36:07 way it's not that easy am a pivot as you 36:09 would say but I very much appreciate the 36:13 Sununu family and the fact that they are 36:14 with me and I am with them and they 36:18 gonna do very well he's going to do very 36:20 well and I see the numbers and and you 36:23 know one of the things that have really 36:24 happened and they all thought old 36:25 truckers look I've never done this and 36:28 but I've done very well in my life and 36:30 business and done a lot of good things 36:32 and but I've never done this so all of 36:35 the reports well you'll take down the 36:36 senator and we'll take down this Center 36:38 you know how well the Republicans are 36:40 doing 36:40 I guess there's a gentleman in Illinois 36:43 that's not doing so well this guy was 36:45 actually taking out ads against me I 36:47 said are you sure he's a Republican 36:49 maybe he's a democrat and he's not doing 36:51 well but hey that's his problem i mean 36:53 you know he was not for me but if you 36:55 look at and he was there was for 36:57 political reasons but if you look at 36:59 what 37:00 going on now they're all talking about 37:02 fact the other day I saw very 37:05 interesting one thing I said you know 37:06 Donald Trump is having a very positive 37:09 effect on these races the Republicans 37:12 are going to hold their doing terrific 37:14 Lee well far better than anyone thought 37:17 and frankly we are winning states and 37:21 we're going to win some states that 37:22 would never in a million years you know 37:24 this being play I mean we have some 37:26 states like we're doing great in 37:27 Colorado somebody else wouldn't do well 37:30 nobody else would do well we're doing 37:31 great i thinkwell bleeding Colorado and 37:33 one of the poles as you know just came 37:34 out we're leaving colorado i just left 37:37 we're leading a lot of places and you're 37:39 doing at least very competitively in a 37:41 lot of states that absolutely would not 37:45 be four Republicans and you know one of 37:47 the funny things they do the maps and 37:49 remember to once again watch the 37:51 different people that do the maps and a 37:52 very small path it's a little stuff for 37:54 the Republicans have to tell you but 37:57 they said there's a very small path but 37:58 i was watching the other day and the 38:01 same person sink 38:03 wow this path is getting a lot wider 38:05 doesn't mean they were happy about it 38:08 but the path now there's four different 38:10 paths because there was one little one 38:12 made silver ornate silver has been you 38:15 know he didn't predict us in the primary 38:17 and he had never called a loser before I 38:19 mean you know he's always been on the 38:21 right side of of what happened in terms 38:23 of at least his predictions and he 38:26 didn't predict me in the primaries and 38:28 in all fairness you know never seen me 38:31 never spoke to me never so what we did 38:34 you know we had 17 very talented people 38:36 and one by one by one was a beautiful 38:39 sight to watch was beautiful being being 38:42 and by the way how those people most of 38:45 them endorsement ben Carson chris 38:47 Christie so many of them endorsed me and 38:50 they're great endorsement scott walker 38:52 has been incredible pants he opens to 38:55 mike pence by the way has been fantastic 38:57 and he did a great job last night 38:59 did great you did great to addressing 39:03 that brings me to another question from 39:06 louis from brentwood Louis Thank You 39:11 Louis 39:11 did you really say Louis asked you were 39:14 you upset about mr. pencils debate 39:16 success as John Harwood said John 39:20 Harwood was the worst moderator at all 39:22 the debates we had dominated we have 11 39:24 or 12 he was so bad at this game is 39:28 nothing about me i was so happy and I 39:31 saw today that somebody on CNN the 39:33 Clinton news network 39:35 who knows nothing about us you know they 39:37 use John King actually is a nice guy 39:39 like him on the map she does a good job 39:40 with the maps I like I'm better now than 39:42 I did couple of months ago because a 39:43 couple of months ago I had no chance now 39:45 all of a sudden that map is getting very 39:47 red but John King said you know they 39:53 always have a source there was ever so 39:56 source within nobody talks to him 39:59 nobody stopped because he's like the 40:00 enemy is like the enemy but he said and 40:03 a few other people said Donald Trump was 40:05 at first happy and then he was unhappy 40:08 because Mike Pence's so well I said 40:12 unhappy with jumping up and down he was 40:14 so good and I'll tell you what he's a 40:16 great human being is a you can't root 40:18 against him you can't fight i was 40:22 telling chris i was telling chris chris 40:24 says they can you imagine these people 40:25 are saying that I would have loved to 40:28 you know seeing them not do well because 40:31 that makes me look better 40:32 these people that's why a guy like John 40:35 King has stayed in the same position for 40:37 like a lousy but it's tienen que I used 40:40 to say I think someday he'll be an 40:41 anchor guess what he's still doing the 40:43 maps but but no I was so happy and I I 40:47 mean I i can i can give you my word of 40:49 this i was so happy that Mike did well 40:53 and I was rooting him on and we were 40:55 talking all during the day and I was 40:56 getting some ideas and we're running 40:58 things by each other and it's so 41:00 disconcerting when you hear even tonight 41:02 they said Donald Trump is going to New 41:05 Hampshire to practice for sunday this 41:07 has nothing to do with sunday and it's 41:10 like they make you into like a child 41:12 and this is that I love the people of 41:14 New Hampshire this was set up a little 41:16 while ago they were going to cancel it 41:19 and I said want you to cancel it well 41:20 you wanted to bake purpose that forget 41:22 the bay prep me to give me a break 41:24 do you really think that Hillary Clinton 41:25 is the bait prepping for three or four 41:27 days 41:28 Hillary Clinton is resting okay she's 41:31 resting she wants to build up her energy 41:33 for sunday night and you know what 41:35 that's fine but up the the narrative is 41:38 so foolish 41:40 I'm here for one reason i love the 41:42 people of New Hampshire i said i was 41:44 going to be here and I'm here very 41:46 simple this one this one is unsigned but 41:52 it's a good question a lot and that's 41:54 trouble would you give to young 41:55 Americans looking to achieve the 41:57 American dream always go into what you 42:00 love doing and you may have parents that 42:02 are trying to push you one way or 42:04 another but you know what you love you 42:05 have to do what you love and I say this 42:09 all the time i say it in speeches and 42:11 everything I mean I'll speak in front of 42:13 young people because i love doing it and 42:15 I say always follow your dream always go 42:19 into what you love and never ever quit 42:22 or give up i've seen a lot of people 42:24 over the years big people not-so-big 42:26 usually it's not so big because if they 42:28 quit their not gonna get so big but the 42:30 most successful people I've ever met the 42:32 people that never-quit they never give 42:34 up 42:34 they just don't take no for an answer so 42:38 do something that you really love doing 42:40 because then it's not work and never 42:43 ever quit or give up i do one or two 42:46 more 42:47 thank you thank you 42:51 I think you've dealt with this one 42:52 before it's from ALB all the sorrow over 42:54 there LOL i'll say that Bell now wants 42:58 to know what you're gonna get 42:59 I want to know what you're going to do 43:03 about the VA are you gonna make it 43:05 possible the veterans as al can tell you 43:07 and has a lot of the veterans in this 43:09 room because I recognize some of you and 43:11 and I've become very close to the vets 43:13 and a lot of it started with New 43:14 Hampshire to be honest in Iowa but i 43:17 really got close to the vets and I'll 43:19 tell you what in many cases they're 43:21 living in hell 43:22 what's going on with the Veterans 43:24 Administration between the corruption 43:26 the long long waits 22 suicide today I 43:30 thought that was a typo when I heard 22 43:32 suicides a desk that's impossible 43:34 22 suicides a day much of it caused by 43:37 the fact that they can't get to see 43:38 doctors how are they wait in line four 43:41 five and six days and at the end of the 43:43 six-day the doctor says sorry 43:45 you know I'm going on vacation and 43:46 actually the Veterans Administration and 43:49 the vets tell me this they have some 43:50 really great doctors but getting to see 43:53 them is sometimes almost impossible 43:56 we are going to solve finally the 43:59 problem of the Veterans Administration 44:00 we have illegal immigrants that in many 44:03 cases are treated better than our get 44:05 great veterans and you know that and 44:06 everybody knows that they're being 44:08 treated better than our veterans and 44:11 that's not going to happen one of the 44:12 things we're going to do is the lines 44:14 are impossible getting to see a doctor 44:18 is in many cases just days and days when 44:21 that circumstance happens we're going to 44:23 let our veterans go across the street 44:25 around the corner two miles away and see 44:30 a doctor 44:32 private or a hospital public or private 44:35 where they're looking for work when they 44:38 have wonderful people they're looking 44:39 for work 44:41 take care of their problem and we will 44:43 pay the bill and that's going to be the 44:44 cheapest thing we can do is going to be 44:46 the cheapest thing we could do 44:49 and.and alcatel you want a lot of the 44:54 vets that I recognized in the room they 44:56 can tell you everybody's in love with 44:57 the plan and we're going to keep the via 44:59 but we're going to we're going to keep 45:00 the Veterans Administration we're going 45:02 to keep the hospital's we're going to 45:03 keep the building because I think that's 45:06 important and we have to take care of 45:08 our veggies are people that we wouldn't 45:10 be here if it weren't for the vets but 45:12 but when they're waiting in line for and 45:15 they know it's there's no end in sight 45:17 and honestly they're dying they need a 45:19 simple procedure they need a 45:21 prescription they need something very 45:24 easy and the end up dying and it's a 45:26 very sad thing so they're going to be 45:28 able to go across the street to a public 45:30 private hospital to a doctor and we're 45:33 gonna take care of our events for the 45:34 first time we're really going to take 45:36 care of our events 45:38 ok this creep from national here natural
