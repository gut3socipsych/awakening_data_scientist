point so the press is protecting her 8:26 the press is totally prepare you ever notice she comes out reads his speech 8:33 and then goes away for a little while 8:38 no press conference and what 255

Giacomo hurt me don't worry about it I'm not nervous Giacomo you're 14:24 not gonna have any problem so these politicians come up to me you know we 14:29 had the debates and I know all the politicians I used to be establishment I 14:34 used to get millions of dollars to politicians who knows the system better 14:40 than me believe me i know this is and then one day I said maybe I'll run and 14:45 they all said no no don't run don't run the politicians also don't run we love 14:51 you Donald don't run 14:52 I was an insider i went from being an insider to an outsider in about two 14:57 seconds and and Iran and i was told that this is the most talented field in the 15:10 history of Republican politics 15:14 and here we are folks here we are 15:23 and a lot of politicians would come up to me and they used to say don't like 15:30 and understand strong border so we have to have strong but you remember in june 15:34 sixteenth I talked about illegal immigration right illegal immigration 15:39 the border patrol agents 16,500 endorsed me Sheriff Joe sheriff's your piyo 15:46 endorse that tells Jaret and by the way the fact that it's about a hundred 15:55 ninety degrees in this room makes me appreciate the people of Connecticut 16:01 even more so 16:07 yeah 16:09 it's great but i love it it's like a work at you go home you lose five pounds 16:14 i say what happened like this is like a sweatshirt of where it but you guys have 16:21 been here for hours you've been here for 3-4 hours 16:24 how the hell do you do that how did you doing 16:31 yeah 16:32 these are amazing people 16:36 so here's the story folks so the politicians they said to me very 16:43 strongly I don't worry about them don't want i'll look the cameras return 16:50 ah 16:51 yeah 16:53 the cameras in turn wow that's great 17:00 those cameras never ever turn unless the protester because see a protester is 17:08 considered a bad thing for Trump all he had a protester so I didn't think they 17:13 could turn but when there's a protester they're like pretzels they could turn 17:17 jack about they can turn like pretzels 17:20 look I did you believe that all the cameras returned our what a bunch i'll 17:28 tell you in particular lately we have a newspaper that's failing badly it's 17:34 losing a lot of money it's gonna be out of business very soon the New York Times 17:39 okay i love 17:42 and they wrote a story today 17:47 anonymous sources have said three anonymous sources 17:51 anonymous anonymous that they don't use names I don't really think they have any 17:57 names ok but anonymous sources have said there are no anonymous that you know 18:03 with my campaign i'll be honest with you it's me it's me they never called me 18:08 they don't call me but these are the most dishonest people 18:14 the good news is i love you know I put down failing at New York Times the 18:21 newspapers going to health 18:23 they've got a couple of reporters in that newspaper who are so bad with I 18:28 mean lack of talent but it's going to help so I think maybe what we'll do 18:34 maybe we'll start thinking about taking their press credentials away from them 18:39 making 18:43 I think I think you know when they write this on his stories 18:51 you can't read them that so much you can read them this so much I'd be reading 18:56 all day long when they write this on his stories we should be a little bit tough 19:01 don't we agree that a real garbage their garbage is a garbage paper okay so 19:07 here's the story folks talking about garbage talking about garbage 19:16 talking about garbage you have a governor in this state has done a very 19:23 port 19:27 and he's back in crooked Hillary Clinton he's a democrat and many of you are 19:36 Democrats but I know you're voting for Trump how many people in this room are 19:39 Democrats it's a lot and how many people are voting for Trump yes 19:47 yeah 19:49 I'll tell you folks i may be wrong and on november eight I'll say what I guess 19:59 I was wrong but there's something going on people are sick and tired of 20:03 incompetent presidents like obama is totally incompetent 20:11 they're tired of a press that doesn't tell the correct story 20:16 alright 20:18 the media the dishonesty they're tired of crooked Hillary Clinton for years and 20:26 years it's going to be the same thing for more years of obama four more years 20:31 of Isis four more years of high taxes did you see 20:35 hey did you see what she did she came out with an economic plan now I have to 20:42 be honest i'll tell you I'm no fan of The Washington Post either although 20:46 they've been much nicer lately i must say i banned them about two months ago 20:51 but maybe i'll let them back in 20:55 they've been much better he say no don't bother probably you're probably right 21:00 but the Washington Post did a big front-page story on crooked Hillary and 21:06 it was done about a week ago 21:09 Washington Post i'm only taken one pitches a big story as Senator Clinton 21:16 promised 200,000 jobs in upstate upstate New York which by the way is a disaster 21:22 area okay i love those people they have lost so much they are great people and 21:30 their with drop I think like a hundred percent ok i won New York State in a 21:38 massive landslide and by the way I one connecticut in a massive landslide 21:49 so it says here as Senator i'm adding 1 we're drunk it Clinton promised 200,000 22:02 jobs and upset today who got the jobs are consultants got the job in upstate 22:07 New York her efforts fell flat 22:10 look at that okay you gotta cameras are now they're turning away you see now 22:16 they're turning away they don't want to see that they don't want to know they 22:22 don't want to see that but her efforts fell flat and i'll tell you the story 22:27 because i was there she was running for the Senate she made all sorts of 22:32 promises and the promises were not kept ok they were not kept and New York State 22:40 upstate New York became a disaster area 22:45 what happened is the jobs left for Mexico and other places she couldn't get 22:50 anything past except the name of a small building some plays 22:53 she had no power in the Senate people didn't respect her she had no strength 22:58 she needs the right temperament she's a week temperament 23:03 although the Secret Service agent said she's essentially crazy so I think I 23:07 believe 23:08 and these guys know her pretty well but you know she said I don't have you heard 23:16 her 23:17 not so long ago reading off a teleprompter I assume she goes you ever 23:24 see her stand up in front of eight nine ten thousand people without a 23:28 teleprompter not maybe maybe I don't think so but she's reading off and she 23:34 said I don't like Donald Trump's tone I don't like Donald Trump's and I thought 23:44 about it so Giacomo she said she doesn't like my tone Giacomo likes Michael so 23:51 she said I don't like Donald Trump stone and I'm saying to myself you know and I 23:57 went to the press with because i asked me about it i said we have people in the 24:02 Middle East whose heads are being chopped off especially if they're 24:06 Christian we have people being drowned in steel cages we are people being 24:13 buried alive in the sand and this politician this no change politician she 24:21 won't change a thing is saying she doesn't like Donald Trump stone she has 24:27 Isis has developed like wild fire under our incompetent President Obama 24:39 I saw the other day they were in eight countries now they think it's 28 24:47 countries during his period 28 countries right there going like wildfire but they 24:55 were in eighth and other and 28 and I actually said to the press and I said to 25:00 a big group of people it's the opinion of myself and a lot of people that he 25:07 was the founder of Isis 25:14 because of his weak policies and because he felt he failed because he failed to 25:21 get them out because he failed to do something about it and I said but they 25:28 wouldn't let that go along that he is going to be presented over the next 25:33 short period of time with the MVP award from Isis most valuable player now they 25:41 didn't put that down you know what they did 25:44 crooked CNN CNN is so disgusting 25:47 CNN 25:50 oh look the camera just shut off their camera just went off 25:57 that's funny i got to know all the cameras all those red lights on 26:00 you know what I just said CNN is disgusting and by the way their ratings 26:06 are going down big-league you know why 26:12 because I refuse to be interviewed and I get high ratings what can I tell you 26:18 what I refuse and it's a constant hit on Trump and people are saying what is it 26:23 no matter what you do no matter how good it is they make it so CNN took this 26:27 story and we said right 26:30 the founder and we said the MVP while they cut it all up so I said I said 26:35 Barack Obama is the founder of Isis that I talked about your own screaming over 26:41 here right then i talked about receiving the most valuable player one and I said 26:48 about her receiving the most what right yeah the mouse her you can keep your 26:54 health care good luck receiving the most valuable players so they cut it so they 27:00 have it 27:01 Donald Trump said that he is the founder of Isis then they debated for two days i 27:06 think is wrong i think these people are so dishonest the media and I loved her 27:16 it's like the baby they said I threw a baby 27:19 it turned out I didn't throw out of baby fact the mother went on television 27:23 saying how she loves me 27:27 I love that mother so so look here's a starbucks remember this you gotta 27:35 remember this because she came out with a plan to vary substantially raise your 27:41 taxes that's all you need in Connecticut more taxes 27:45 she is going to raise your taxes 27:49 she's going to raise your regulations for your businesses which is going to 27:53 put everybody out of work 27:55 Obamacare's he wants to keep and make it more expensive and you're gonna have by 28:03 the way you are going to have increases come November the likes of which you 28:08 have never seen on your horrible Obamacare remember keep your plan 28:14 keep your doctor all a big lie 28:17 remember the scam artist the young you know semi smart guy that came out and he 28:24 scared the public and he was bragging to his friends unfortunately one of meta 28:29 camera he was Gruber grouper my man he remembers see the problem is people 28:36 forget but I won't let her forget grouper what was his first name Jonathan 28:42 Gruber you're very good Jonathan group and what school did he go to 28:47 he taught at school Jonathan Gruber from MIT my uncle was at MIT for many years a 28:55 teacher to my dear professor jonathan gruber of MIT market down remember he 29:00 said the whole deal is a scam and he was bragging to his friends I don't know 29:06 what kind of a friend but he had a cell phone running I don't think it's a good 29:08 friend but you know what 29:10 probably his so-called friend was even incensed at it 29:14 Jonathan grouper of MIT said Obamacare is essentially a scam 29:20 so now in Texas just recently through bluecross blueshield they announced 29:28 almost a fifty percent increase 29:32 almost a fifty percent increase now what's going to happen is on november 29:39 first remember those folks on november first they are going to announce 29:45 earth-shattering election shattering an increase that so big that you will never 29:52 ever in a million years vote for Hillary Clinton but remember this 29:57 they wanted delay and I tell you this to the Republican Party you better get 30:02 tough 30:03 they wanted to lay until december first till after the election 30:06 don't let it out so here's a story Washington Post she thought she did not 30:15 fulfill what she said it's a wasteland what happened and what she did was a 30:21 disaster 30:23 the people in upstate New York hate Hillary Clinton a hater 30:27 she lied to him she lied to him 30:30 she lied to him you have to go up there 30:34 her husband Bill Clinton who by the way 30:44 remember what he said he did not have sex with that woman then a couple weeks 30:51 later are you got me 30:54 I'm so glad they kept the dress I'm so glad they kept that dress 31:00 alright it's great you know why because it shows what the hell they are all 31:07 right 31:07 it shows what they are so here's the story as Senator Clinton promise 200,000 31:15 jobs now here's in the New York Post very recently by a great writer Steve 31:21 cazzo how Donald Trump help save New York City 31:31 long before Donald Trump stamped his name in gold on buildings around the 31:36 world post his sake midnight tweets that's true and join the race for the 31:41 White House he was new york's most important and bravest real estate well i 31:47 did a good job identical 31:50 whatever you think about his political views 31:55 alright I understand that but they say or his campaign this is crazy it is 32:00 pretty while the face Trump doesn't get enough credit for being a transformative 32:08 planner who is in love with the city of New York i'm also love with Connecticut 32:13 by the way I'm really I'm really in love with our country 32:32 I 32:34 Trump waded into a landscape of empty fifth avenue store friends by the way 32:40 new york city was a disaster you remember nobody wanted to invest it was 32:45 over 32:46 remember President Ford said go to hell it was over for New York it was going to 32:51 go down the tubes Trump waded into a landscape of empty fifth avenue store 32:56 fronts the dust ball muggings and ground around Central Park in a wall street 33:02 area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out does that sound 33:07 familiar companies companies were moving out like crazy which was then a remote 33:13 off your eyelid you are the developers built anything but plain vanilla office 33:18 and apartment building strap almost by force of will and by the way this is a 33:23 great writer is a tough writer 33:26 they're very smart guy tough critic trump almost by force of will 33:31 Road to the rescue expressing rare thing that's what we're going to do for the 33:38 country folks 33:47 now this is a long article that talked about a lot of the jobs that I've done 33:51 expressing rare faith in the future he was instrumental in kick-starting the 34:00 regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead now 34:07 in all fairness because I you know I look I have like 80 people she's got a 34:15 thousand they're hiring like crazy 34:19 we're doing great we're raising a lot of money I'm putting up my money for me i'm 34:23 raising money for the Republican Party I'm raising money for the republican 34:28 party but up you know in the primaries I put up my money here i'm putting up a 34:33 lot of money folks I got a lot of money in this boy I'll tell you what 34:39 but i'm not going to be controlled by lobbyists i'm not going to be controlled 34:44 by special 34:50 yeah 34:52 yeah 34:54 so so here's the story she is totally controlled by the hedge fund people who 35:03 I know very well these are either fine but these are not nice people 35:10 these are not people that say I'm doing this for the good of the country 35:14 they're doing this for the good in themselves and when they give two 35:17 million three million five million 10 million to crooked Hillary Clinton 35:22 they're gonna get a lot back and it's gonna be a lot more than that and what's 35:26 gonna happen what's gonna happen remember this 35:29 they are going to make deals that are bad for a country but good for them 35:34 including deals where certain companies can move to Mexico and other places 35:40 because a lot of Marrone by these guys and you know what folks if I get in 35:45 that's not going to happen ok because i couldn't give a damn for so here's what 35:52 happened recently campaign contributions from hedge funders right you see the 35:59 Knights picture i used Hillary how pretty pretty 36:02 see how pretty she is now they gave me a very bad picture of her 36:07 they gave me a picture that wasn't representative of what Hillary look like 36:12 and i said i'm not using that picture I probably should have but I'm a true 36:18 sportsman right so I i said we have to use a nice picture but here's the bad 36:24 part of the picture 48 million by 500,000 received from the hedge funders 36:33 and that's center for responsive politics very respected right so it's 48 36:40 million five hundred thousand for Hillary nineteen thousand bucks for 36:44 Trump and I'm trying to figure out who the hell gave me the money I can't 36:50 believe that they gave it i'll probably give it back 36:54 aera energy 36:57 what is your name 37:07 total national debt so when obama became president he has now doubled our 37:15 national debt and i'll tell you 37:20 I'll tell you the problem with that 37:23 by the way I I you didn't get what i said but I loved when CNN turned off its 37:29 camera as soon as I started telling you what sleaze they are 37:35 I just hella that camera folks can you imagine having it on live television but 37:40 you know the good thing nobody is watching them anyway so from here 37:50 look at the corner of that room they even have people standing behind the 37:54 cameras you know what if it were up to me I'd move those damn cameras the hell 37:58 out and let the people see properly I'd give him out 38:06 so here's our president 38:10 here's our president who is by the way going to go down as perhaps the worst 38:17 president in the history of this country 38:20 believe me believe so here's our president he's doubled our national debt 38:27 and yet our country's our mess our roads haven't been built our infrastructure 38:34 our tunnels our bridges our hospitals 38:40 nothing's working we have bridges many of them are in danger of falling down 38:45 you see the reports so we have this massive debt we've taken money he's 38:51 wasted it i'll tell you i saw one was that a certain community 34 days ago 38:57 great i'm not going to mention the community because they're heavily in 39:00 favor of Trump they're building a Veterans Administration Hospital not a 39:05 real big one there 1.2 billion dollars over budget hospital how many builders 39:10 are here people can you imagine 1.2 billion dollars over budget now I would 39:16 be willing to bed that some of those subcontractors and contractors i love 39:21 our contractors i love our subcontractors but we have to be smart 39:25 because they're smarter than people that went to Harvard and wharton &amp; yale and 39:34 some of them don't even speak the language well but they're smarter so 39:39 this is a hospital built in our country 39:42 not so far away 1.2 billion dollar cost over what about that and this is just 39:49 standard i'm building a hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the 39:55 white house i said i don't give a damn i'm coming to Pennsylvania Avenue one 40:00 way or the other 40:05 trump international 40:10 it was the old post office building it was the old post office building is one 40:15 of the most beautiful buildings in the country 40:18 can you imagine i got it through the Obama administration does that tell you 40:23 how good I am does that tell you 40:27 I actually told my people I said now now we want is one of the most hotly 40:33 contested jobs in the history of the GSA and by the way the GSA people are very 40:37 professional 40:38 we have some very good people in government with a little leadership this 40:43 country is going to sail it's going
