0:00 and gentlemen please welcome the next president of the United States of 0:03 America Donald J Trump 1:12 yeah 1:15 thank you everybody 1:19 it is great to be in North Carolina 1:27 really a special place i love it really an amazing an amazing place and you know 1:34 we had a great primary victory here and i'll tell you what it's been it's been a 1:40 wonderful experience we have been during the state all day I hear we're leading 1:44 in the polls in North Carolina and come November a we are going to win this 1:54 state and we are going to win back the White House 2:03 and when we do that we are going to bring our jobs back to North Carolina 2:07 that i can tell you and we are going to have a great victory for the people it's 2:14 going to be for the people so we have two and we don't have any choice replace 2:22 a very failed and very corrupt establishment with a new government that 2:30 serves you your family and your country and that's going to happen 2:36 Hillary Clinton represents insiders she represents the donors the politicians 2:44 the big banks the multinational corporations and everybody getting rich 2:49 off a very rigged system and we know that 2:56 she represents everyone responsible for the decades-long squeezing of the middle 3:03 class the middle class in this country has been treated so unfairly as jobs and 3:10 wealth moved to other countries like Mexico and plenty of others 3:16 Hillary Clinton is the chief emissary for globalism and I'm not running to be 3:23 president of the world i'm running to be President of the United States 3:48 running to represent america and america first and America is going to come first 3:55 from now on it's no longer going to be in second position 4:00 Hillary Clinton is the vessel for all of the global special-interest seeking to 4:05 run our government and our lives and it's not going to happen anymore and 4:13 what we've done is we've created a movement all over the country it's like 4:17 this 4:18 look at these crowds look at the people outside the thousands of people outside 4:21 look at what's going on all over the country we've created a movement and the 4:27 people we are going to do and what we have done for the people people are 4:33 energized now like they've never seen before I think we're doing records it's 4:37 called in energy as opposed to some of my opponents 4:45 and all of the people pushing the disastrous trade deals all of these 4:50 people they're making a fortune in Washington pushing trade deals that take 4:55 jobs away from North Carolina and all these states those days are over the 5:00 jobs are coming back 5:06 all of the people there just pushing everything but all of the people they 5:11 keep digging and digging and digging us into a halt and i'll tell you open 5:16 borders we're going to end you see what's happening with our open borders 5:20 that's all gonna end the people trying to rig our financial system and our 5:26 economy are the people giving their money to Hillary Clinton our campaign is 5:32 about breaking up this special interest monopoly I understand special-interest 5:37 believe me we are going to break up the monopoly of the donor and the 5:42 special-interest we're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors 5:47 the large corporations and the media executives all of whom want to keep 5:52 things exactly as they are right now 5:56 good system 5:58 and we know it's a rigged system all you have to do is ask Bernie Sanders and 6:03 you'll see with the super-delegates day they did a number on burning they did a 6:11 number and they're trying to game you know we have a little debate coming up 6:14 very shortly right right 6:19 so we had sort of a forum the other night and that worked out very well and 6:24 matt lauer did a very good job but by trying to hit Matt they're trying to 6:30 game the system like game the ref and but I think Lester Holt will be very 6:35 fair but a lot of people are going to be watching to see if that's true the 6:39 reason why so many corporate newspapers and news anchors are opposed to our 6:44 movement is the same reason why the lobbyists and the donors are movement 6:51 hello 6:56 see now here's the problem so i wouldn't pay the mic guy right 7:02 the mic your shot 7:05 that was a weird sound wasn't it so i wouldn't pay the Mike guy and they'll 7:09 say isn't that terrible he didn't pay his bills but people don't do a good job 7:13 for me and obey Him it's one of those things 7:21 my father my father taught me that a long time ago probably your parents told 7:25 you that 7:26 anyway they're all part of the same political system so they go to the same 7:34 restaurants they go to the same conferences they have the same friends 7:38 and connections they write checks to the same think tanks and produce exactly the 7:46 same reports it's a gravy train and it just keeps flowing on november eight 7:52 that special interest gravy train is coming to a very abrupt and 8:07 the insiders in Washington and Wall Street look down at the hard-working 8:12 people like you like so many people in this state like so many people in this 8:19 country but you're the backbone of the country and I understand that and you 8:25 understand that you are the people that make the country run you are the heart 8:33 and soul of the nation and you don't ever ever ever forget it 8:39 don't ever forget it folks 8:44 Hillary Clinton lifted the veil on this whole corrupt scheme when she called you 8:51 deplorable and irredeemable 8:59 these insiders the political elites as they say you see it 9:06 ok you see it they're supposed to be okay 9:10 believe me I like what we have together what we have together is special 9:17 what we have together has never been together before like it is right now in 9:23 this nation's history 9:29 and when we have rallies like this i have to say we have rallies like this 9:35 and we have seven eight nine ten thousand routinely those are like the 9:40 smaller crowds we were in pensacola the other day we were no matter where we go 9:46 and Hillary goes out for rallies and yesterday I think she had 200 people she 9:52 had 200 people maybe 300 i'll say 300 because they'll say I was wrong what we 9:58 have folks is something special that's why on November if you have to get out 10:04 and you have to vote but that's also why on october 20th i believe you can go 10:10 early and you can do your ballots and you have to do it and you have to get 10:14 all your friends out because if we win North Carolina were up in Florida were 10:20 up in Ohio we win North Carolina we're winning we're gonna win 10:26 so october twenty 10:34 Clinton doesn't see you as people to serve but subjects to rule over 10:40 hello-o said friend or foe said friend 11:02 her friends see you as people who are entitled to run this country or this 11:07 government and that's what they see they don't want you or your family to have a 11:14 voice that's why I'm running I am your voice i promise i will be the greatest 11:20 voice you've ever had 11:25 we'll bring our government back to the people will break up the donor media 11:31 industrial complex because there is nothing so dishonest as our media and 11:38 not everybody not everybody honestly not everybody but a large portion of it and 11:45 it's very very unfair and its blood this country dry and that's given us all of 11:52 the problems combinations of different groups all of the problems that we have 11:57 today 11:58 Hillary Clinton is the last line of defense for a failed political 12:03 establishment believe me and she does not have you and heart all of their 12:10 money all of their hopes for another generation a corruption all of the 12:15 corruption the tremendous corruption that's what we have vested her now i 12:21 will say we have just gotten some reports and we're getting these 12:27 phenomenal poll numbers and they're saying that our expenditures on 12:32 advertising our expenditures on people our expenditures on everything are tiny 12:38 fraction and yet we're minimum tied and we might probably actually be winning 12:44 spending a tiny fraction spending a tiny fraction 12:50 now in the old days and for the business people here of which we have many if you 12:55 spent less had fewer people did less advertising and a one-state i think they 13:01 said we did 150th 150th spent less advertising and we're winning 13:08 they used to give you credit for that in our country right now with this politics 13:12 they say what you should have more people you should spend more money I'm 13:16 saving myself it doesn't work that way if you can spend less and be winning 13:21 that's a positive thing right 13:22 that's the person you want as your president I think the Clinton campaign 13:33 exists for one reason and that's to continue breaking and and look you know 13:40 what's going on you know what's going on 13:42 it's rigging the system just like she rigged the system for her donors when 13:48 she was Secretary of State what happened 13:52 what happened when she was Secretary of State was a total disgrace 13:59 so her conduct as Secretary of State giving all of these special favors was 14:05 something like we have never seen in this country before and then you can 14:11 take a look at emails you can take a look at all of the things that happened 14:17 all of the money that was made all of the disgraceful conduct its really 14:24 exhibit a against our truly and I I can't say corrupt system because it's 14:31 not a totally corrupt system it's a system that's out of control is it's a 14:36 system it's just off kilter we're gonna put it back into kilter folks we're 14:41 going to make America great again we're going to make it quick 14:46 we're going to make America 14:47 now i have to tell you I have to tell you a couple of things because this is a 14:57 group that likes jobs right we can we can talk about Hillary Clinton four 15:03 hours we can talk about the rig system we can talk about the 33,000 emails that 15:09 were deleted we can talk about all of the problems that are countries had you 15:14 look at her with Libya you look at her with all of the different things look at 15:19 Isis Isis was formed in the vacuum that she and barack obama created they 15:25 created this vacuum and Isis was formed now she's telling us how to get rid of 15:32 Isis right i don't think so now i don't know if you've heard but over the last 15:39 number of years she's wanted five hundred and fifty percent more Syrian 15:44 refugees to come into the United States two days ago 15:50 two days ago President Obama said and very strongly said that he wants a 15:57 hundred and twenty thousand some vast number hundred and twenty thousand to 16:02 come in to the United States look at the problems we're having now look at the 16:07 problems that the world is having now look at what's going on 16:12 we can't allow it to happen we can't allow it to happen and it's not going to 16:18 happen now what is going to happen 16:27 what is going to happen and this is so important and i just think it's one of 16:32 those things that we're going to see because it's politics Hillary is all of 16:38 a sudden going to get tough the debate comes and she say I want strong borders 16:43 I believe she made the term extreme reading where did you hear extreme 16:47 vetting before only from me because I made up the term I mean I came up i said 16:51 we need extreme vetting to come into our country all of a sudden 17:01 all of a sudden she's got extreme vetting and she's got all of these terms 17:07 folks it's not going to happen and the reason it's not going to happen is 17:12 because they're special interest donors they like it when our businesses move 17:16 out because they owned businesses they moved to Mexico lots of this really lots 17:20 of advantages for them to do that 17:22 no advantage for our country no advantage for our jobs so i'll give you 17:28 a couple of examples and I think it's horrible 17:31 ford motor company just announced that they're moving their small car division 17:36 anybody hear this to Mexico unbelievable numbers of jobs tremendous numbers of 17:44 jobs and we're not going to let it happen we're not going to let this we 17:49 lost in North Carolina you lost forty four percent of your manufacturing NAFTA 17:54 has been a disaster for North Carolina NAFTA has been a disaster for this 18:01 country you go to Pennsylvania you go to Ohio you got all of these states 18:05 you got a new york state you go to New England look at what's happened to our 18:10 country 18:11 we're not going to let it happen any longer we're not going to let them take 18:14 our business is any longer 18:16 these corrupt politicians we're not going to let them take our businesses 18:20 any longer it's not going to happen 18:25 ok it's not going to happen 18:30 we won't let it happen now we have a tremendous problem with immigration but 18:38 we have a tremendous problem with job loss and we have a real problem with 18:43 good jobs because we're keeping jobs their bed jobs they consider we're 18:47 losing our good jobs so a couple of examples you remember what happened in 18:54 Indiana recently with carrier air conditioning right 18:58 they fired all their employees they said we're moving to Mexico congratulations 19:03 it was captured this firing on somebody's beautiful cellphone a great 19:07 thing because if I didn't see it in the cell phone it would have meant that much 19:11 and have other people didn't and it happened to be just before my primary 19:14 and Indiana which I wanted a landslide largely because of character so so what 19:22 happened what happened is they let their employees go they're going to move to 19:26 Mexico tremendous I tell you what tremendous advantages were given to 19:32 carrier to stay but they decided to fire 1,400 people and go to Mexico they're 19:40 building a brand new plant and I wish him well but here's the story folks this 19:44 could have been stopped years ago the politicians didn't either understand it 19:49 or if they did understand that they certainly didn't want to do it 19:52 I actually think it's a combination of both but what's going to happen is the 19:56 following if we had somebody I would love to do it myself but I'm not sure 20:01 president is supposed to call up the head of an air conditioning company 20:04 explained to him why why they're not going to do that but i'll tell you what 20:11 we are going to tell them in the nicest of language mr. president of carrier 20:18 I'm sorry if you think you're gonna leave Indiana Indianapolis to be exact 20:24 fire all these people get rid of everybody 20:27 we have no income no taxes no nothing you're going to move to Mexico into a 20:31 brand new plant you're going to make product you're going to make your 20:33 air-conditioned sell them through are very strong border because by the way we 20:37 will build the wall we will have 20:49 yeah 21:01 yeah 21:02 now now we're building the wall we have a very very strong border who's going to 21:08 pay for the wall 21:12 do you even have a doubt how do you have even do you have even a doubt 21:17 so what we're going to do is we're going to tell carrier and everybody i hate to 21:24 use carry only is but he there a perfect example they may care conditions good 21:28 air conditions i used to buy my wall by me what I made but never buy an air 21:32 conditioner again if i win 21:34 okay if I lose I may be buying a lot but I don't know this is much more exciting 21:39 than the real estate business to be honest with but we're going to tell them 21:43 that look if you move we are going to charge you 21:49 thirty-five percent every time you make an air conditioner and think you're 21:53 going to sell it back into our country 21:55 ok 35% 22:01 and I'll tell you what will happen every single time like ninety-eight percent 22:07 98% they're going to say well let's go get a lobbyist now I'm putting up my own 22:14 money and I'm into this thing for a lot of money folks okay i'm putting up my 22:17 own money 22:18 I don't know if it's ever happened against Ross Perot put up his money but 22:21 i'm putting up my money I'm raising money from the small donors and some 22:26 larger donors going to the Republican Party the RNC rights purposes by the way 22:32 doing a great job but we're raising money for the republican party but i am 22:36 putting up millions and millions and millions of dollars so if you don't go 22:40 out about I'm gonna feel very very foolish I'll tell you i'm going to say 22:45 one of the one of the pundits that it doesn't matter whether he wins or loses 22:51 what he's done has been amazing 22:53 it's never been done before you know what I say to that if I lose I wasted a 22:58 lot of time energy and money that's the way I look at it I don't I don't view it 23:02 the way they look at it and i will say it has been an amazing experience but 23:07 here's what's gonna happen 23:08 we're going to say to them and I have the greatest business people in the 23:11 world back in me Carl Icahn so many different business people and well we 23:16 have to use our great business people we have to use our great negotiators on 23:20 trade and they'll say look here's the story if you move mr. carrier if you 23:26 move its fine enjoy your new plant the weather is hot but that's ok enjoy the 23:31 new plan but if you move is going to be this tax they're not going to move folks 23:36 they're not going to move they're going to say well we're gonna stay now they'll 23:39 stay in Indiana they may come to North Carolina all of that stuff is fine right 23:44 but they're not leaving our country so easily 23:48 we can't continue to be the suckers that allow thousands of companies millions of 23:54 jobs to be lost by moving their manufacturing plants and factories to 23:59 other country we can't do it 24:01 we can't we cannot do it so one of two things is gonna happen either they're 24:09 not moving they're staying in Indiana or the United States and this goes for many 24:13 many companies there are many companies right now in North Carolina that are 24:18 talking about moving to Mexico and other places i hate to tell you have a chop 24:22 you think you have a good job you better get back immediately stopped listening 24:25 to this the fact is you have companies right now where you work that are 24:29 negotiating to move out of North Carolina ok they're negotiating to move 24:34 out of different states and our politicians do nothing about it and the 24:38 reason is two reasons number one they're not very smart 24:43 number two there a lot of times they're taken care of by donors and special 24:48 interests that want them to move out they have reason to have them move out 24:52 especially when you can make your product and sell it into the United 24:56 States was no tax no nothing so either they're going to stay which most of them 25:02 will because the numbers don't work anymore would have to pay that tax or 25:05 they're gonna leave it we're gonna make a fortune every time they sell something 25:09 into this country so it's okay i don't care but we're not going to have it any 25:14 longer 25:15 where our company's fire everybody moved to Mexico and other places and then 25:22 after all of that work or we end up with unemployment and nothing 25:27 ok and they end up with great jobs great factories a friend of mine and you might 25:32 have heard me say this but it happened a month in Africa 25:36 he's one of the biggest in the world that building plants he builds plants 25:40 big car plants big all kind of plans 25:42 that's all the pills if you told him building apartment house he wouldn't 25:45 maybe know how to do it but he builds great plans and I said to him how's 25:50 business 25:51 unbelievable really that's good how is that I mean the United States not good 25:56 here I said what I mean not good here said you got to see Mexico we're 26:00 building plants he said to me 26:02 Mexico is the eighth wonder of the world is going to be the car capital of the 26:06 world 26:07 michigan is getting killed Ohio is getting killed a lot of states are 26:12 getting killed including by the way north carroll 26:15 china they getting killed your jobs are being moved your company's moved down to 26:20 Mexico and two other places but mexico in particular 26:25 china is a disaster we have a trade deficit with china 500 billion dollars a 26:33 year trade deficit by the way our trade deficit with mexico is also a massive 26:39 its massive 26:40 but we have a 500 billion dollar trade deficit with China and let me tell you 26:45 something that's not going to happen with me 26:48 it's a it's a two-way street we gotta remember it's not a one-way street you 26:52 know when boeing goes and wants to sell plane to China they making bill plants 26:56 and after those plants and I told this to the people in South Carolina who I 27:00 love but they have a big Boeing complex but they're now building a big Boeing 27:06 complex in China when that complex is built and they start devaluing their 27:11 currency and they start playing around because their currency manipulators like 27:15 nobody that's ever been there even better than japan in their prime and 27:20 they start selling airplanes at prices that this country can compete with I'll 27:25 tell you what you got to be careful but that's what's happening right now when 27:29 they when boeing made their deal with China China took their intellectual 27:34 property they took so much and if they didn't take it wouldn't matter because 27:39 they steal intellectual property so I'm just saying this i will be the greatest 27:44 jobs president that God ever created that i can tell you that I can't 27:50 yeah 27:53 and Hillary Clinton doesn't have a clue 27:56 not even a clue now when it comes to the border and some of you have heard it and 28:01 some of you haven't who has heard the snake how many people raise your hands 28:09 not too many so that's maybe ten percent should i do what should I not too huh 28:15 yes I'm going to do it i'll tell you what to me love it because it's so 28:20 descriptive not complex at all but it's so totally descriptive we need strong 28:28 borders we can't have people coming into this country who don't love our people 28:35 and love our country that's all and we want people we want people to come into 28:42 our country we really do we want to come into our country but they have to come 28:47 in through a system and they have to come in Legally right now they're 28:51 pouring across the borders 28:54 you know I was endorsed by the Border Patrol agent 16,500 agents they've never 28:59 endorsed a presidential candidate before ever 29:03 they've never endorsed the presidential candidate they endorsed by considered a 29:08 great honor these are great people that want to have a strong border they're 29:12 told to stand back let people come and stand back 29:15 we don't know what we're doing and then to have the Syrians come in who just 29:20 today it was said they really can't be vetted and I don't know of anyone so i 29:25 think was 868 people did you see that there was scheduled for deportation and 29:31 instead of being deported 29:33 I don't know if they pressed the wrong button or was there something dishonest 29:37 going on one of the other so instead of being deported they became citizens of 29:44 the United States almost a thousand people 29:48 that's yesterday he's gonna hit the jackpot tonight they're gonna be 29:52 deported something happened and they became citizens of the United States 29:57 folks this could be the great Trojan horse we have people coming into our 30:02 country we have no idea they're coming in from the Middle East we have no idea 30:07 who they are i use the term extreme I made it up now Hilary is copying it but 30:13 we need extreme reading but we don't need anybody until we find out what's 30:17 going on from these regions of the world and we want to help and we want to build 30:22 safe zones and we want to have other people pay for the safe zones because 30:26 right now we have 20 trillion dollars worth of debt 30:32 it's going to be very destructive unless somebody very very good and very very 30:38 smart and knows what he in this case I have to say he's two of us is doing is 30:46 doing but I will tell you 30:49 president Obama has doubled the national debt so over 200 years of death and in 30:58 seven and a half years he's doubled to think of it so we have almost 20 31:03 trillion dollars so we're gonna get Gulf states who are loaded up with money 31:08 loaded up with money we're gonna get the Gulf states to pay for safe sounds will 31:14 lead the project like it's called OPM I do that all the time in physical other 31:20 people's money there's nothing like doing things with other people's money 31:24 because it takes the risk you get a good chunk of it and it takes the rest we're 31:28 going to do this in this case from humanitarian standpoint OPM other 31:34 people's money will do safe zones but we cannot have these people come into the 31:41 United States we don't know who they are we know nothing about him 31:45 you saw what happened two days ago we cannot continue these policies we have 31:51 enough problems in our country 31:53 look at what happened to Germany look at what's happening in France we cannot 31:57 allow this to happen 31:59 Hillary Clinton wants open borders 32:02 he wants people to pour in Barack Obama just approved over a hundred thousand 32:06 people three days ago to come into this country from Syria we can't do this 32:11 folks we're not gonna have a country left okay and think about that and then 32:18 i'm going to read the stake out Wilson years ago he wrote it it's actually a 32:25 song pretty cool song but the words for what I'm talking about because we don't 32:31 know what we're doing but actually if you sit down and think about it we know 32:37 what's gonna happen and this is what's going to happen if we keep allowing 32:41 these open borders and if we keep taking in tens of thousands of people that we 32:47 frankly know nothing about and your law enforcement will tell you that they know 32:53 nothing and there's no real way to vet these people on her way to work one 33:00 morning down the path along the lake a tender hearted woman saw a poor 33:08 half-frozen snake his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the do 33:16 oh well she cried I'll take you in and I'll take care of you take me you know 33:22 tender woman take me in for heaven's sake take me in 33:27 Oh tender woman side the broken snake she wrapped him up all cozy in a 33:35 curvature of silk and then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some 33:41 milk now she heard home from work that night as soon as she arrived she found 33:48 that pretty snake she take it in had been revived take me an O tender woman 33:55 take me in for heaven's sake take me in 33:59 Oh tender woman cried the broken snake now she clutched him to her bosom 34:06 you're so beautiful she cried but if I hadn't brought you in by now 34:12 surely you might have died now she stroked his pretty skin and then she 34:17 kissed him and held him tight but instead of saying thank you 34:24 that snake gave her a vicious bite take me in 34:32 Oh tender woman take me in for heaven's sake take me in no tender woman side the 34:38 vicious think I saved you cried the woman and you've bit me heavens why you 34:46 know your bite is poisonous and now i'm going to die 34:51 oh shut up silly woman said the reptile with a Griffin you knew damn well I took 35:01 you in you knew damn well I was a snake you knew everything about me b4 you took 35:10 me in a very simple very simple very very simple 35:19 very very simple very so we have a situation where it's not so different 35:29 now let's go over a couple of things because we have to repeal and we have to 35:34 replace Obamacare to disaster 35:40 I don't even have to talk about you know I used to explain it and I used to say 35:45 that we have a really serious situation where your premiums are going up your 35:50 deductibles are so high you never get to use it the premiums are through the roof 35:54 the deductibles are so high it's a disaster were repealing and replacing 35:59 we're going to take care of our vets were going to take care of our military 36:02 we are going to take care of our guests 36:10 we're going to appoint Supreme Court justices that truly believe in our 36:16 Constitution ok big thing that's a big thing we're going to get rid of common 36:25 core bringing education local 36:31 we are going to protect our Second Amendment which is underseas wonderful 36:44 totally under seas and we're gonna protect it and the NRA these are great 36:48 people they endorsed me and i'll tell you what between Supreme Court judges 36:54 Second Amendment Obamacare and then obviously most important are depleted 36:59 military all of these things we have the greatest people on earth in our military 37:03 but it's so depleted with the equipment they're getting with all of the problems 37:09 they have we are going to rebuild our military and we're going to take care of 37:14 our vets we have to 37:19 and lastly we have some of the worst trade deals ever made 37:28 headed by NAFTA other countries have ripped us like you've never seen before 37:34 vast parcels of land throughout our country including this state are empty 37:42 with falling buildings empty just empty when you see it it so said you see 37:49 buildings that were vibrant 30 years ago and now those companies are gone into 37:53 other countries in particular into Mexico and a lot of them have closed 37:57 because of what China's done to us we are going to renegotiate our trade deals 38:03 with our smartest and best business people those ills those deals are going 38:10 to be from horrible job sucking deals to we're going to reverse it we're going to 38:19 have a highway that goes into directions not in one direction out of the United 38:24 States we're losing our jobs were losing our taxes we're losing our money and 38:29 it's getting worse 38:31 okay just so you understand you think it's over it's getting worse 38:35 in fact it's getting worse by far we are going to be a traitor we're gonna have 38:40 free trade i believe in free trade but we're going to make great deals instead 38:44 of horrible deals because NAFTA and these horrible deals that were signed by 38:49 numerous people the World Trade Organization disaster for us the Korean 38:55 trade deal you got to see signed by and up wanted by Hillary Clinton one of the 39:00 worst deals I've ever seen it was going to add hundreds of thousands of jobs to 39:04 the United States instead it's the exact opposite and it's been a great deal for 39:09 south korea it's been a horrible deal a horrible deal for the United States so 39:15 we are going to make our country so rich again and a woman came up to me a 39:21 wonderful woman 39:22 not so long ago she said you know mr.
