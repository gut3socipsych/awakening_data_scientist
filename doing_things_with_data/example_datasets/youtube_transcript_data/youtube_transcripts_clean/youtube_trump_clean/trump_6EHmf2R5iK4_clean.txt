0:00 welcome the next president of the United mr. J 0:13 yeah 0:33 I love Las Vegas 0:36 I love this state 0:39 and if you ever need a room i have a very nice building right down the street 0:43 now 0:45 hey and I have to thank mr. and mrs. Phil roughen the room is great 0:51 we've got people in every room he's got over here his restaurants in our full 0:55 this is what took so long and the worst thing we can do folks because we're all 0:59 together right this is a movement 1:01 the worst thing we can do is start a rally because if there's one empty seat 1:06 the press will show all the room didn't fill up Trump is it good 1:09 outside you have thousands of people trying to get in and i hate to say it 1:20 because i like them and they work very hard tsa lets them in and it's not 1:25 working out so good i'm not happy about it but I have to put up with it but they 1:31 have you know the machines and they didn't bring enough machines and I don't 1:36 know of the great Wayne Newton has that problem when he performs but I love way 1:41 and i'll talk about waiting in a sec but we have to be very careful of that 1:46 because let's say I came out 10 or 15 minutes ago 1:49 even though there are thousands of people outside all of the conference 1:53 rooms that people have closed circuit television the hotel respect 1:56 Phil you've never had anything like this and he owns it 1:59 so if i had like three empty seats there say oh this is terrible and they are 2:04 still piling into this room but I think it's time we begin do we agree 2:09 the weekend ok so we have amazing people here are amazing friends are here and 2:18 it's been going really well you know I read about this is an insurgent group 2:24 you know the same group that I be is insurgent there are a couple of guys are 2:28 trying to go to claim they're trying to get delegates 2:30 I thought they already tried that I mean I could give you names but I won't 2:34 because it's meaningless first of all to legal 2:37 second of all you can't do it third of all we not mean we got 14 almost 14 2:45 million votes 14 million votes in the primary system 2:49 so that's more votes than ever received in the primers in the history of the 2:57 Republican Party 2:59 ok like we be a lot of people 16 people there were a total of seventeen 3:07 including myself 3:09 one after another boom boom boom 3:12 it was a beautiful thing to behold ok a beautiful thing 3:17 it was a beautiful thing yeah that's great just keep filling them and that's 3:21 right 3:22 is it better that we're starting now we have to they're not happy outside but 3:26 what the heck are we going to do 3:27 so it was a beautiful thing to behold 3:32 but think of this so we get almost 14 million votes 3:35 we won 36 37 states which is some others one nun people that one none are saying 3:45 maybe we can get something at the convention doesn't work that way folks 3:49 you would have because we have you know one of the things the polls say we have 3:54 by far the most loyal followers right by far by far 3:59 you know other of the candidates well I mean take a look at this today 4:04 they've never had anything like this where every room is full every 4:07 conference room every restaurant is loaded with people i believe you were 4:12 closed circuit and fight for me so I didn't feel they're gonna be so angry 4:15 but I think you did this guy doesn't hold back believe me but 4:21 so when we get 37 states when we get 37 states 4:28 we love our police 4:32 we love our police 4:36 Thank you Thank You officers 4:42 thank you 4:49 thank you 4:54 that's very nice thank you by the way how great are our police ok they don't 5:00 get enough ground they don't get enough credit you know they take abuse they 5:07 don't get the credit they deserve believe me 5:10 so we won 37 states we want 14 million we be Ronald Reagan who we love 5:19 we beat Richard Nixon we beat dwight d eisenhower 5:23 we beat everybody we beat bush we beat the bushes will be proposed and by a lot 5:33 i mean we like edge didn't I don't mean like you know I mean by a lot and now 5:39 you have a couple of guys that were badly defeated and they're trying to 5:44 organize maybe like a little bit of a delegate revolt 5:48 maybe now number one you know rights previous you know what that is right 5:54 rnc know he's a good guy and the Republican National Committee they put 5:58 out a statement you can't do it is not legal you can't do it you're not allowed 6:01 to do it 6:02 how would you like to have a party where we started off with 17 or 18 people 6:07 actually including somebody that i won't mention because I'm not looking to 6:11 embarrass anybody was actually 18 if you want to include somebody 6:15 ok 6:17 but how would you like to have a party Wayne and he's married to a great lawyer 6:22 so she understands this better than when does but weight has a much better voice 6:26 right but how would you like to have a party where myself and others traveled 6:32 the country and worked for a long time now with shorter than I thought because 6:37 remember i was supposed to maybe be able to pull it out at the convention and we 6:41 pulled it out two months before the convention 6:44 do you remember do you remember when they said 1237 that's the delegates 1230 6:55 he cannot reach that number 6:57 he cannot reach that number and I kept saying what's the big deal 7:01 and one of the people who probably hasn't quite given up yet 7:05 one of the people was trying to buy up all of the second ballot people right 7:11 and I kept saying let him have them because it's expensive to get him 7:16 and by the way i spent less money than any other candidate and i ended up in 7:23 first place and they ended up 7:29 so now I here after beating him fair and square 7:33 I mean I beat him fair and square actually a couple of the commentators 7:36 centered negative people actually because most of them are but a couple of 7:39 the commentators that negative people said whether you like him or you don't 7:44 he beat them fair and square and and then they said he didn't beat them by a 7:53 little bit he beat them by a lot we beat them by a lot right 7:58 so how would you like to have a party where somebody goes out and beat them by 8:02 a lot and winds not only the vote largest in the history of the party 8:07 not only wins 37 states and nobody else was even you know like remotely close 8:13 I mean some of these guys have none how would you like to have that a guy set an 8:18 all-time record gets almost 14 million votes over a period of like nine months 8:23 he gets 37 states 8:28 he gets tremendous support has sold out arenas no matter where he goes let 8:32 yesterday and in houston 8:34 people said they have never seen crowds like that one of the reporters a very 8:39 good reporter actually from NBC 8:41 Haley she just said what are your cramps as big as they used to be acid dip Baker 8:45 they're bigger they're actually bigger another bigger you had to see used in 8:54 Texas last night 8:56 we're in a big hurry to held about 5,000 people that's not a big one for us but 8:59 those the biggest one we could get on short notice and on short notice 9:04 we had a line that went five abreast forever and it's the biggest subject in 9:11 all of Texas they had helicopters over they couldn't believe what they were 9:14 seeing 9:15 they've never seen anything like it and our crowds are bigger our enthusiasm is 9:20 more a poll came out 9:23 Oh am a very good Paul very he's actually they it's a very good group of 9:27 people 9:28 a Palo en came out where I'm statistically even with crooked Hillary 9:33 and she is crooked folks believe she is 9:37 Hillary Clinton doesn't have 9:40 I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton you can say it any way you want but she 9:45 doesn't have the integrity 9:47 she does have the integrity to be President and perhaps equally important 9:53 she's got very very bad judgment you just look at what she's done 9:57 you just look okay so how would you like to be in a party where Trump wins 10:05 where Trump keeps when where Trump has the biggest crowds where drop dead 10:12 spider the way the highest ratings in the history of television 10:17 they had a story and variety I don't like to brag but we have to break every 10:22 once in a while they had a story in variety 10:26 we're a big headline a big massive headline and the story was that Trump 10:32 makes massive profits for cable networks and networks but massive and then I want 10:37 to say that they're setting records and viewership they're setting records and 10:40 advertising 10:41 they're making a fortune what are we getting at and we get nothing but maybe 10:45 but maybe we're going to get the presidency and we're going to straighten 10:49 out our country 10:51 ok we're going to straighten out our country 10:55 yeah 10:59 and we'll have Wayne at that inaugural ball Wayne will be with me way 11:03 baba so so there's a little movement and and I just heard today where it's coming 11:10 from it's coming from cut people that have been badly defeated but wouldn't 11:14 that be funny 11:15 ok I got much less for you got no states 11:19 ladies and gentlemen our nominee is I don't think so 11:25 I mean forget about the legality because it's not legal to get about the fact 11:29 that the Republican National Committee put out a statement last night saying 11:32 it's all made up by the press folks believe me by these people right here 11:38 it's all made up by the press ok 11:43 it's all made up it's it's it's a hoax 11:46 I'm telling you these are the most dishonest people 11:51 not all of them not all of them but these are this is a story i watch CNN 11:56 yesterday 11:56 knowing it can't happen breaking news 12:00 there will be this and that at the convention who are they going to pick 12:04 I beat everybody but i don't mean be 12:07 I beat the hell out of fun right there 12:15 and we're gonna beat Hillary 12:19 and it would be helpful if the Republicans could help us a little bit 12:23 yeah okay just a little 12:25 yeah 12:29 and then I have people that are so that I've done so much for that frankly we've 12:34 done a great job for all of us 12:36 you know the Republican Party has increased the voter turnout for the 12:41 forget about me 12:42 I set the all-time record guess what the republican party in the primaries has is 12:49 up seventy percent right 12:52 I think it's even more seventy seventy percent from four years ago 12:59 seventy percent more people have voted in the primers 13:03 is it because the main stand up say a woman 13:07 I'm doing well with woman go ahead 13:15 thank you 13:17 believe me I respect women more than Hillary respects women i can tell you 13:22 that 13:22 thank you 13:25 they're screaming it's because of You mr. jump is because of you and you know 13:29 what I never brag 13:32 they happen to be a hundred percent all right we do you take a look at these 13:38 states a couple of the states were up a hundred and two percent from last year 13:43 ok from four years ago a hundred and two percent it's unheard of in the whole 13:47 world 13:47 people talk about it I mean some people would have said the Republican Party is 13:51 stayed at bed states 13:54 I you know it's got a little boring maybe and maybe the ideas weren't right 13:58 because I don't believe in the Big let it be boring of the ideas are right but 14:02 the ideas were right there wasn't strengthen the border 14:06 our budget's away out of whack look at this last budget that we approve the 14:10 Omnibus Budget you know obama is a horrible negotiator 14:15 iran iran beats him every country beats him he draws the line in the sand they 14:22 beat him 14:22 everybody beats him but he's a great negotiator when he has to negotiate 14:26 against the Republicans how we got to stop 14:30 we got to stop we gotta stop they have to focus on budgets not focus on me and 14:37 they view me as an outsider I have to tell you a little secret i shouldn't say 14:40 that you're half of you will leave the room should i say it 14:42 I used to be the ultimate establishment person I was a massive giver 14:49 I gave a lot of money to everybody I even gave the Democrats and then I'm in 14:53 business right 14:54 I gave the Democrats i gave to report but I gave a lot of money 14:57 the

there's no paper they come 22:01 from hostile countries they came they come from countries that are tremendous 22:07 in terms of terrorism and we're going to have big problems if you think Orlando 22:12 was the end of it with this week attitude and this pathetic president 22:17 that we have it wasn't folks 22:19 it wasn't it wasn't this is just the beginning 22:24 unless we get smart and tough and vigilant and unless we say I'm sorry 22:29 you're coming from a region in the world whether it's and I can name all but like 22:35 a name all but its radical Islamic terrorists 22:40 it's a whole

watched him 22:56 the other day and he was and and by the way this wasn't just me saying it 23:01 he was more angry at Donald Trump that he was at the shooter the maniac who 23:08 killed all of those young people 23:10 he was more angry at Donald Trump and I wasn't the only one to say it 23:17 plenty of people saw it then he was at the shooter 23:20 so we got to change your mindset here folks we have to be really tough really 23:26 smart really strong 23:27 you know in the past would have a war and would be fighting Japan and their 23:32 uniforms 23:33 we knew who we were fighting and would be fighting Germany and we'll be 23:36 fighting others and we knew who our opponent was we knew who the enemy was 23:41 today 23:42 you don't know who the hell it is and you are going to have 23:46 have you are going to have problems 23:50 the likes of which you've never seen unless Donald Trump becomes your 23:56 president 23:57 police thank you 24:19 thank you 24:21 yeah 24:23 now we're going to bring jobs into our country and that's going to solve a lot 24:27 of problems it's amazing how jobs can solve a lot of problems problems that we 24:32 think we have all of our somebody somebody gets a good job and you don't 24:36 have the problems but we're having our jobs 24:40 ripped off and being sent to other countries ripped off by currency 24:45 manipulation where they're lowering the value of their currency and they're 24:49 making it impossible for our companies to compete 24:53 we're being ripped off at every level and we have leaders that are so stupid 24:57 they have no idea what's happening 24:59 I mean look at the newspapers today Apple good old Apple 25:04 I was waiting for this to happen they've been having their stuff made in China 25:08 and now China has turned against him now here's the bad news 25:12 by my saying that china's first part they're gonna say up like Trump strict 25:16 up this one will let Apple i am doing such a service to apple pie even 25:20 mentioning it because our word is being broadcast all over the world and tim 25:25 cook should send us a lot of money for what i'm doing but China is now ripping 25:31 off apple saying you don't have the right to sell a certain product in China 25:36 we are somebody else has the right and they're ripping them off big league and 25:43 right now 25:44 apple doesn't know what to do but it always happens 25:48 but you watch because of this will be a headline now China the smart 25:53 I deal with him the very smart you can do great with him i made a lot of money 25:56 with China the biggest bank in the world is my tenants i sell condos like crazy 26:00 the people from China the bank of america building in San Francisco 26:03 indirectly through China 26:07 I mean so much so much stuff I did great with China and I have great respect for 26:12 each other i'm not knocking china and I'm not knocking Mexico and I'm not 26:15 knocking Japan 26:16 I'm not knocking anybody I think it's great what they do for themselves but I 26:22 am knocking our leadership is being grossly incompetent they don't know what 26:26 the hell they're doing 26:27 they don't 26:28 what they're doing and every time and and and offers china is just one of many 26:38 but China is the biggest and it's the biggest abuser 26:41 China's an abusive they abused our country every time they start doing 26:45 badly do you notice they knock out their their currency a little bit lower a 26:51 little bit love that supposed to be doing that that's not like cheating 26:54 you know it's a way of cheating now we do it very little because we don't have 26:58 like they're like Grand Master's they like Grand Masters and we're like 27:03 checker players that don't know how to play 27:05 that's now that's a difference but it won't be that way 27:08 Carl Icahn guys like Ruffin guys like so many of my people that are back to me so 27:14 many of the people that Phil knows these are the best business people in the 27:18 world these are the best negotiators in the world 27:21 these are the best negotiators in the world and you know what you know what 27:27 it's very interesting we're going to put it up 27:30 I'm the best oh I'm good good 27:34 but we have the best we have the greatest business people have the 27:38 greatest negotiators in the world 27:40 you know we have the greatest and dbl is a big supporter andy beal back in Texas 27:44 we have such unbelievable people that are supporting me and they support me 27:49 not because they like me although I guess that's a part of it but they're 27:52 supporting because they hear me 27:54 you have your corporate inversion we have companies that are leaving this 27:57 country 27:58 taxes are too high and they have trillions of dollars outside of our 28:03 country they can't get it back 28:04 we can't get it back because we have no leader you know we have trillions of 28:08 dollars right now outside of our country i think it's five trillion they say it's 28:12 two and a half three and i think it's much more 28:14 we can't bring it back the Democrats want to bring it back 28:18 the Republicans want to bring it back everybody who the hell doesn't want to 28:22 bring it back 28:23 it's money that we aren't allowing to come back in because the bureaucracy 28:27 it's actually not just access the taxes are crazy 28:30 only a maniac would bring it back and pay those it's crazy - hi hi it we pay 28:36 the highest taxes or by the way 28:38 I have the biggest tax decrease of any candidate that's run for office and 28:43 that's list of 20 people and Hillary Clinton has the biggest tax increase and 28:50 she doesn't even want to talk about it in my opinion her taxes have to be close 28:55 to sixty percent to pay for what she's talking about 28:58 and she got forced into a corner by crazy Bernie one thing about birdie 29:02 he doesn't give up this guy doesn't give up 29:06 right crazy Bernice 29:09 he doesn't give up yeah crazy burn he's crazy as a bedbug but you know he 29:17 doesn't quit 29:19 he doesn't quit gotta hand it to and I think Bernie should continue to go 29:24 forward folks 29:26 he should continue to go forward he should fight to the last end 29:34 well he's waiting for really the FBI to do what everybody thinks they're going 29:39 to do 29:40 I mean I think that 29:45 I think he sort of saying look huh let's hang in there because ultimately it's 29:51 called the FBI convention and then we'll be the only people and we will have done 29:57 something like Trump did I want to be like drop I want to be like drop but I 30:03 think he's waiting for the FBI convention 30:06 we'll see we'll see we'll see if the right thing happens 30:09 everybody knows what the right thing is I've watched in red and seeing and talk 30:14 to great legal scholars not one has said that she should be allowed to run for 30:19 office every person that we know of 30:23 that's done far less than what she's done 30:26 their lives have been destroyed and the press doesn't cover it because the press 30:32 is so one sided CNN as an example 30:36 it's called the Clinton news network Clinton knows that worked up 30:41 it's a job it's a job 30:43 yeah 30:44 the Clinton is that work so we'll see what happens but bernie is in there and 30:50 Bernie's fighting and I don't think you should give up does anybody think so i 30:54 don't know if he gives up with a Bernie you're a loser you gave up we kept it 30:59 now but we'll see I mean he's got to have something in mind that i personally 31:03 think that's maybe what he has a much 31:05 so we're gonna do things for our country 31:08 they're gonna be amazing and they have resonated look one year from thursday 31:14 Iran and everybody's jun 16 1 year so it's one year in two days now 31:20 one year one year and a lot of people said i watch call roll 31:30 he said well he's not gonna run oh I watched Krauthammer no he won't run 31:34 crowd ever said he won't run 31:37 he who are because this is the single greatest group of talent 31:42 perhaps in the history of the Republican part track two months before i said to 31:48 my wife wow I just don't forget Krauthammer wanted us to go into Iraq 31:52 and bomb the hell we did a great job by doing that I was against doing that box 31:55 I was against it 31:57 these guys all wanted to bomb the hell out of Iraq we've done a great job in 32:00 doing that we have totally destabilize the Middle East what a mess we have ok 32:05 what a total mess we have and by the way who takes over Iraq Iran 32:11 not only do they make the Iran deal i used to say that's the greatest still 32:15 have seen they got a hundred and fifty billion dollars back 32:18 they have the right to go wild with nuclear weapons eventually they don't 32:22 need to make them they can buy them but you know what they make right now used 32:26 to say that's one of the greatest feelings I've ever seen I don't say that 32:28 anymore greatest deal is that for years 32:30 years and years decades and decades they fought each other and 11 10 feet this 32:36 way ten feet that way 10 feet 3 4 years then they rested then they go again 32:41 again again 32:42 Saddam Hussein drops a little gas around complaint you're not supposed to do that 32:47 the world goes crazy and then the rest then again 32:52 ok this is going on forever then we come in and obliterate one of the two 32:58 obliterated and now what have we done 33:02 we have given Iran Iraq ok 33:05 as sure as you are setting that I resent this for a long time but Iran is 33:09 essentially controlling Iraq Iran is now very shortly to just walk it then I have 33:15 to fire a shot and the people running Iraq are so in the pocket over and and 33:22 why wouldn't they be 33:23 because they figure week on you know wig on 33:26 so Iran is going to take over a lot of people don't know that Iraq has some of 33:32 the largest oil reserves in the entire world a lot of people don't know that 33:36 so look what's happening look what's happening to Iran look what we've done 33:41 by sheer stupidity 33:43 so a lot of these people as they said bomb bomb bomb and I said although I 33:48 what did I know I was in business right 33:50 I didn't know a lot of people weren't asking me but I said if you do that 33:53 you're going to destabilize the Middle East and hence you have the migration 33:56 and head your people going all over the world 33:59 look at the problems in Germany look at the crime i have friends in Germany that 34:03 for years it's a the greatest country the greatest country they love Germany 34:06 now they're saying we're leaving we're leaving Germany 34:10 look what they've done to different look at brussels how beautiful the place was 34:15 Brussels and look at what's going on look at paris look what's happening in 34:19 Paris and it's far worse than you people understand forward to people understand 34:23 that today there was actually a story that Paris is 34:27 so so so out of control so dangerous 34:31 look at what's going on and we have Hillary Clinton wanting to take in over 34:37 five hundred percent more than obama now think of it then Obama of people that 34:46 will cause us problems like you will not believe 34:49 not all of them but look what one man did one whack job he's a wacko 34:54 look what one whack job did one radical Islamic terrorists and he pledged 35:00 himself to Isis 35:01 he's a guy he's shooting people and placing himself to Isis says he's 35:05 shooting 35:06 ok he's calling people and talking about Isis Isis 35:12 look what one man has done to this country 35:15 look at what one man has done to the state to the great great great state of 35:19 Florida that i love and orlando amazing place 35:23 this is one man we're letting in millions of people 35:27 it doesn't take large about this could be the great Trojan horse 35:32 we all know the story of the Trojan horse but this could be the great story 35:37 of the Trojan horse 35:39 all because we have leadership and weak people like Hillary's week 35:44 she's weak she Bernie Sanders said about Hillary Clinton that she can't be 35:50 president because she has bad judgment 35:52 ok he said it I didn't said I would never say a thing like that and then I 35:58 hear her 35:59 I hear her saying you know reading right off always teleprompters she goes 36:05 Donald Trump 36:07 does not have the temperament to be President and then the you know the the 36:16 people back 36:17 all she gave a great speech i'll give me a brac gave a great speech 36:21 you think she's the president take a look at her you think she's the 36:24 president I don't think so 36:25 I don't know 36:27 Donald Trump does at the temper and I'll tell you something I started thinking 36:30 about it and I was going to say I absolutely have a great temperament and 36:34 I've done great things look I went into television had the apprentice 36:39 great hit one of the most successful reaction i did books many bestsellers 36:44 many the art of the deal is one of the biggest selling certainly the biggest 36:47 selling business book of all time by far 36:49 so I did books tremendous success real estate i have some of the greatest 36:53 assets in the world 36:55 you look at my numbers very low dad tremendous everything ok 36:58 I filed over a hundred and some odd pages but listen to this 37:02 okay so listen so we have we have a great study in contrast 37:08 so I started thinking about temperament and I was going to say i do have a good 37:11 temperament they do and then I said to myself wait a minute 37:14 she's probably right about one thing I have a very tough temperament she said 37:18 you know but very controlled but we need tough temperament today we can have this 37:22 weakness 37:23 we can't have root my temperament stop my temperament is very solid 37:30 I don't lose control yeah I've been doing this for a long time folks you've 37:34 been watching me for a long time you know in New York I want in a massive 37:38 landslide 37:38 who knows me better than the people of New York nobody knows me better 37:42 nobody 37:45 I want in a massive landslide we have three people now New York dollars me but 37:49 I've been there for a long time 37:50 if I didn't have a good temperament I couldn't afford a new york they know me 37:53 i will do i get publicity 37:55 do I get they write about me every day every hour 37:59 it's always been this way i don't know why i don't know why they had their 38:02 debate 38:03 so Fox in the debate had 24 million people actually even more than that but 38:08 20 for many people the largest audience in the history of cable television 38:14 now I don't think it was for jen but maybe I'm wrong ok 38:17 by the way Jeb is working on the movement just so you understand 38:25 I love competition like that i love it so so look look low energy 38:31 I didn't say it you did ok no Jeff is one of the people that's working and the 38:36 other one should be obvious to you but we'll figure that out very easily 38:39 okay ready so so when you look at when you see and when you see what we have to 38:44 do we have to get out there 38:47 we have 24 million people they watch we have 23 the next two weeks 38:52 CNN puts on a debate 23 million people 38:56 the largest audience in the history of cable television for CNN history and 39:03 covers Wars covers everything right 39:05 we have the largest audience in the history of cable television and then a 39:09 few weeks later 39:10 oh yeah they do say the debate with Hillary will be it's gonna blow 39:13 everything away 39:13 oh I look forward to that debate oh do I look forward to 39:20 I look so forward to that debate but but think of this so CNN 39:27 a few weeks later has a another debate and they get the largest audience 39:32 they've ever had in the history of CNN you know it's pretty impressive rate and 39:36 variety of the magazine's say the Trump the bay 39:38 drew record right he's ok just like they said the profits but here's the thing 39:42 about the debate 39:43 so the debates go on and a lot of people say what was the biggest surprise what I 39:47 didn't know myself as a debate because I never debated i create jobs that do 39:49 deals i do business i do this stuff I don't debate i guess my life is a debate 39:53 but I don't debate professionally and I hear all these politicians that the 39:57 papers we debate Hillary Clinton supposedly said to pay to give me a 40:00 break 40:01 will she be allowed to bring the teleprompter onto the debate stage so so 40:07 so what happens is we start to debate and I never did it before and I'll say I 40:12 think of that i was in 11 debates and of the 11 debates that was left of the 11 40:18 debates 40:19 I was on center stage for every single event meaning your number and of and of 40:27 the 11 debates of the 11 debates Drudge fantastic I Time magazine slight they do 40:35 pulse 40:36 I think I really help the polling business and they talk about what I like 40:39 balls but only if I'm winning I don't like him otherwise 40:43 and we're starting to catch up very rapidly so pretty soon the poly 40:48 companies are gonna have their day in the Sun pretty soon I think 40:51 but here's the story so of the of all of these two basic the seven of them they 40:55 cover 40:56 they have online pulse hundreds of thousands of people vote and on every 41:02 single debate by every single Paul 41:05 I want every debate which is pretty good which is pretty good 41:09 you know I don't know I think it's pretty good but we are going to do 41:15 things that are going to be great and a lot of people don't want me in because 41:18 they don't want to see strong borders 41:20 okay then I want to see strong i want to see strong borders they don't want to 41:23 see me a job creating they don't want to see what i'm going to do to help at the 41:28 minorities because we have problems in this country we 41:32 I will do more for African Americans than Barack Obama has ever ever ever 41:37 done and believe me he's done nothing 41:40 he's done nothing he's done nothing but talk 41:44 he's done nothing but top 41:49 and Hispanics so I employ thousands of Hispanics 41:54 thank you where's Miriam where is barium parish 42:02 yeah 42:03 thank you I employ thousands of his Spanish where's Miriam 42:07 she shot she doesn't want she has been so amazing 42:11 where is thank you thank you she goes around and says Donald Trump is going to 42:18 do more for Mexicans and Hispanics and and I appreciate it thank you thank you 42:24 thank you very much I appreciate it thank you darling 42:31 so nice now she's been amazing and she she knows because i'm going to bring our 42:37 jobs back folks would you bring a judge like look at carrier 42:40 they fired everybody they're moving to Mexico so many companies moving to 42:46 Mexico 42:47 I mean I have a list that's a mile of their moving to Mexico firing everybody 42:52 then they make the product not only in Mexico they make the product they sell 42:57 it into the United States no tax no nothing 43:00 and you know what happens we're gonna lose a lot more companies folks will 43:03 lose a lot more companies 43:04 if I'm president we're not going to lose anything we're not gonna lose any 43:07 companies we're not gonna lose and I say that strong because you know what these 43:12 guys don't know I've been watching this discussion because for seven or eight 43:17 years we have been just it's been an onslaught and longer than that in all 43:21 fairness to obama long before Obama it was called me after it was signed by 43:27 bill clinton and it didn't affect Bill Clinton but it affected everybody that 43:31 followed bill clinton and believe me folks 43:34 it has been a disaster for this country when I won New York State and 43:38 Pennsylvania when I one Maryland Connecticut and Rhode Island y1 all of 43:43 these states and then 1 Indiana 43:46 Thank You Bobby Knight boy did Bobby Knight help 43:49 why did Bobby Knight that was a coach Knight 900 wins but when I want all of 43:54 these states 43:55 I really got to know even New York State I know it well I knew there were 43:59 tremendous problems upstate New York but i had no idea when I toward those 44:03 upstate areas of albany and roam the real run from New York 44:08 ok that's what i call that the real but but Syracuse and you see building after 44:14 building after building empty falling down and just a horrible sight all over 44:19 you could buy them folks you could buy him for a dollar 44:23 and you know what i'll give you may be some real estate advice go out and buy 44:27 him and if I win you're gonna make a hell of a lot of money 44:30 ok in fact phil radford will get up and leave before the speeches over he's 44:37 headed to upstate New York right there now but it's true 44:41 show building after but by the thousands by the thousands and I have 44:47 statisticians that work for me 44:49 and before I used to speak when we were in the primary i'd say give me the 44:52 information upstate New York give me the information on one island give me the 44:56 information on on all of these different places pennsylvania in particular 45:00 look at West Virginia what they've done to our coal miners they've destroyed 45:04 Hillary Clinton said I put the coal miners in the mines out of business 45:07 that was not a smart statement and that she had to go there for over 45:11 and look at the numbers I've gotten in West Virginia and Pennsylvania but I 45:15 look because we're going to bring the coal industry back and we're going to 45:18 bring every industry we're going to bring our energy industry back we're 45:22 going to bring it back 45:23 we're going to bring it back you know because of technology folks because of 45:28 technology we have learned things frankly and we realized that we have 45:33 well that we never knew we had over the last six or seven years there are many 45:36 forms of technology that have given us an awareness that's unbelievable 45:41 what's happened is unbelievable so we're going to bring all these things back and 45:45 we're going to start paying off our debt and we're not going to let our companies 45:48 now here's what we're going to do so carrier says they're leaving 45:51 I would call them and say very nicely and you know my wife gives me a very 45:54 hard time she said 45:55 darling you're president you cannot call an air conditioning company is it that's 46:00 ok it's so much fun 46:02 it's like a two-minute call if I can say 1,400 jobs in two minutes let me do it 46:06 but i'd call meaning i call somebody calls somebody calls 46:11 I got a call maybe I should do it right 46:15 and I say very simply he just fired 1,400 people you're moving to Mexico 46:21 enjoy it enjoy it 46:23 I respect Mexico so much for taking all of our businesses so much of our 46:27 business but let me just tell you here's the story every air conditioning unit 46:32 that you make that you sell across are now very very strong border 46:37 you will be paying a thirty-five percent tax so that you know if you if you now 46:45 our country has been working on this problem for years and they did all sorts 46:50 of deals like the zero interest loans and we'll give you money what that they 46:54 don't need money don't want money 46:56 how about the deals where they gave them really cheap money and they left anyway 46:59 you know I mean it's like great 47:00 try collecting did anybody hundred percent 47:05 they don't mean if I talked to him for two minutes Phil would you say two 47:09 minutes or do i need three I think into he says one it is Phil Phil said one 47:17 minute but in a quick conversation we're not going to move and they're not going 47:22 to be calling lobbyists because you know I spent 55 million of my own campaign of 47:26 my money 47:27 ok of mine 47:31 and by the way if the Republican Party and I hope they all come together 47:36 because i wanted to come together it's great but if for any reason they get a 47:40 little bit like they don't want to help out as much 47:43 then I'll find my own campaign I'd love to do that I'd love to do that you know 47:49 right now i'm raising a lot of money for the republican party and a lot of 47:52 beneficiaries so that and I like doing it but we have to have help 47:56 we have to help they have to be it's got you know life is like a two-way street 47:59 right it's a two-way street so they have to otherwise i'll just keep the one what 48:03 i'm doing i just keep funding my own campaign i'm ok with that that's the 48:06 easy way 48:07 I mean for me that's the easy way but hopefully I can continue to go the way 48:12 we're going this weekend we raised a lot of money we've raised a lot of money for 48:15 the Republican Party will keep doing it because we do have tremendous support 48:18 within the party that i can tell you we have tremendous support 48:21 ok so what's going to happen with carrier what's gonna happen with any up 48:25 is there going to say we want to talk about this then you're going to go hire 48:29 lobbyists the lobbyists are gonna call i say i'm not giving you guys anything 48:33 now if they call Hillary a hundred percent they have a lobby they have a 48:36 lobbyist in Washington 48:37 he's got Hillary Clinton stepped on his forehead okay 48:41 two hundred percent with me it doesn't work that way okay with me it doesn't 48:46 work that way 48:46 within 24 hours they will call let's say sir we've decided to stay in the United 48:53 States will stay in Indiana or they'll go someplace else 48:57 but they're staying in the United States now multiply that times thousands times 49:02 thousands and thousands of companies that's what you're talking about 49:07 you're not talking about a hundred companies or 10 you're talking about 49:10 thousands of companies have left thousands of companies are being killed 49:15 by monetary manipulation 49:18 ok thousands we're not going to let this happen remember this 49:23 china we have rebuilt China they have taken so much you know we are china now 49:28 1.7 trillion dollars think of it 49:30 they beat us at every front they kicked the hell out of us and we owe them money 49:37 how about Japan we aren't you pay 49:40 and 1.6 trillion dollars 49:43 now think of that one they sell the cars the big boats come in the biggest ships 49:47 you've ever seen 49:48 I mean if Wayne Newton could ever get his big audiences on to one of the ships 49:54 you would be very proud of telling you when when when you stand up again 49:58 come out quick I mean 50:04 we love this guy we love Wayne 50:08 we love are you know it's not like a weird experience because all of my life 50:13 I've been watching Wayne Newton and now i'm performing for him what the hell is 50:17 going on over here and the problem is I like him better than I like myself 50:23 so anyway so so all of this is going to come back now you have people in both 50:29 parties that don't like the things I'm saying 50:31 ok you have people in both parties but you know because i have the smartest 50:36 people a lot of people are saying that that's even showing up 50:39 I have the most dedicated

Border 51:49 Patrol agents endorse Donald Trump 51:52 they've never ever endorse the president of company and I asked them and they 51:58 told me they said mr. Trump you need the wall and sheriff joe arpaio great guy 52:03 top right Sheriff Joe from Arizona in fact when I finish this I'm going to 52:09 Arizona i'll be in Arizona a little while doing the same thing with big big 52:14 beautiful crowds but sheriff joe endorse Donald Trump folks we know what we're 52:22 doing 52:22 ok we know what we're doing we are going to make this country so strong again 52:29 we're going to save your social security 52:31 we're going to save your second Amendment which Hillary Clinton wants to 52:35 abolish 52:38 Hillary Clinton wants to abolish your second Amendment and I got the 52:43 endorsement of the National Rifle Association the NRA one of the earliest 52:50 endorsements have ever given and let me tell you between Wayne and Kris and all 52:56 of those people 52:57 these are great people these are people and it gets lost gets lost in the debate 53:02 these are people that love our country just remember that these are people that 53:07 love our country and you know i said before some people thought it was a 53:11 harsh statement but if in Paris where a hundred and thirty people that toughest 53:15 gun was in the world by the way there were no guns on the other side 53:18 these thugs walked in probably if they were if they knew they were they 53:20 wouldn't have gone in there in the first place okay 53:22 they knew there were no guns but toughest gun was in the world hundred 53:26 thirty people die 53:27 san bernardino 14 people die friends they were friends 53:31 they killed 14 people and so many so badly injured by the way Paris the 53:35 hospitals are still loaded with people so horrible and what we had this weekend 53:41 if there were a couple of folks man woman had a gun strapped right here 53:49 right here right here 53:54 yeah 53:56 or a gun strapped very nicely to the ankle and this no bed is no good sick 54:05 sick perverted horrible terrorist terrorist was in there starting the 54:13 shooting one of those people would have had those bullets going the other way 54:17 folks it would have been a whole different story would have been a whole 54:21 different 54:27 so we're gonna make our nation rich again we're poor nation we lose to 54:31 everybody we defend Japan they don't pay us the right money they will they will 54:36 you know the press david says the second I said don't know in a deal 54:41 you always have to be prepared to walk they'll tell you that you always have to 54:45 be prepared that you want to walk but you have to be prepared 54:48 so he is Hillary Clinton what you heard about what I said about you but he is 54:51 not being loyal to our allies we will always stay with our relat well now 54:55 they're never going to negotiate 54:57 why would they negotiate why 55:00 but we have all of these nations that we defend South Korea try buying a 55:04 television outside of South Korea is not easy 55:07 I by thousands and thousands of television sets very tough to buy him 55:12 outside of South Korea except for Sony which not doing so well lately okay 55:16 from japan but let me just tell you 55:20 south korea we defend causes a fortune 55:23 they pay something but not what they should be paying Japan we defend 55:27 billions and billions of dollars a general gets up Donald Trump is wrong he 55:33 was sent by Obama nice-looking guy 55:36 general he said doesn't he understand that Japan pays us fifty percent of the 55:42 cost 55:43 so he sent two paces fifty percent of the cost of their defense 55:47 so the press call me mr. Trump they said that Japan pays fifty percent of the 55:52 cost 55:53 how are you how do you respond I said what do they pay a hundred percent right 56:01 all right i mean with defending japan so we defend Germany Germany think 56:08 Germany's origination I want to thats a rich about tell you what kind of 56:12 problems with what she did but regardless rich nation 56:15 now we have saudi arabia saudi arabia when the oil prices were high was making 56:24 1 billion dollars a day we pay rent on our bases we pay them rather we defend 56:32 Saudi Arabia now listen 56:33 saudi arabia I have a lot of friends from Saudi Arabia all that stuff right 56:37 but you know what this is a country that has nothing but money they have nothing 56:42 but money not strong defense that if we weren't there they would have been gone 56:48 25 years ago 56:49 ok 25 years ago you remember the incident with Iraq when Iraq went into 56:53 Kuwait and then they started looking at saudi arabia and the city's didn't do so 56:58 well and then we had those Marines of ours with the stuff under their eyes and 57:01 boy that was into that 57:04 remember that people forget people forget these little stories faults so we 57:08 defend Saudi Arabia 57:11 they don't pay us nearly what they should be paying so essentially we 57:15 subsidize all of these countries South Korea with this guy called him a maniac 57:20 call them whatever you want 57:22 every time he raises his hand or races his head 57:25 we send our ships or planes at this we have 28 thousand soldiers on the line 57:31 between north and south korea they pass peanuts 57:34 how stupid away how stupid away a country like Saudi Arabia wouldn't exist 57:41 for a week 57:42 you know when I ran took over Yemen they don't want 57:45 yemen they want the border because it's a huge long border between so they want 57:49 the oil and Saudi Arabia 57:51 that's why they fight for Yemen that's why they're in there fighting hit think 57:55 of this 57:56 we're making a deal with Iran and we're fighting Iran in Yemen when you make the 58:01 deal aren't you supposed to solve everything 58:04 and Kerry said he didn't want to bring it up because he didn't want to 58:07 complicate the negotiation 58:08 this guy's an idiot don't think of it 58:12 yemen we're fighting them there on the other side where on one side we don't 58:16 know whose side one because you know we're on the side of the rebels 58:19 we have no idea what the rebels are you ever see all our apples are rebels 58:22 turned out to be worse than the guys that were there in the first place 58:24 we're on the side of the rebels and then the rebels turn out to be like the worst 58:30 but we're fighting 58:32 I ran there on the other side and we're fighting fighting and he's at the 58:36 negotiating then he goes on a bicycle race he breaks his leg and 73 and I tell 58:41 people I give you my word I will never enter a bicycle race I promised during a 58:46 major negotiation 58:48 I mean the guy comes out he's got a whole thing with the outfit the helmet 58:54 all deal right the element i think even had the stickers are right i said what 59:00 is this guy 59:00 he thinks he's in the Tour de France or something what is he doing 59:04 we're in the middle of a very important negotiation that frankly he should have 59:08 walked away from until we got our prisoners back and he should have never 59:11 agreed to get back two hundred and fifty billion dollars but here's a guy in the 59:16 middle of a negotiation breaks his leg and he is out of business 59:20 I meant it I can't tell you folks it is and I think the reason I have this 59:24 tremendous support because you know what a lot of its common sense 59:28 ok a lot of its common sense 59:30 it's not even it's not even like you know you could say it's a great business 59:34 ready 59:34 a lot of its common sense ninety-nine percent of the people in this room would 59:40 do just as well I mean it's like simple stuff we're being led by people that 59:46 don't know what they're doing now here's what's gonna happen 59:49 so we're going to start winning again we're gonna have strong borders we're 59:52 going up the wall we're going to be respected again we're gonna win with our 59:55 military we're gonna knock the hell out of Isis we have to do that folks that i 59:57 have to tell you 59:59 normally i would say no but it's gotten to a point 60:04 and because of the power of weaponry we have to do that we really have no choice 60:07 so we gotta knock the hell out them but our military is totally depleted you see 60:11 our old Jets where we're taking parts from playing airplane graveyards and 60:15 museums we have the plains and the museums are using them as our fighters 60:18 and other countries have modern fighter jets 60:22 this is the United States of America can you believe what's happening to us so 60:26 we're gonna our military is depleted horribly depleted smaller than it's been 60:31 in many many years and it's probably going to be bigger right now because I 60:34 don't know if there's ever been much more of a threat that we have right now 60:37 so we're going to build up our military with the equipment that we want 60:42 we're going to take care of our veterans because our veterans have been horribly 60:46 horribly treated 60:49 we're gonna make great great trade deals and we're gonna bring jobs and money 60:55 back into our country 60:59 yeah 61:00 we're going to create a border and borders generally that is strong and 61:06 powerful 61:08 we're going to get rid of common core and we're going to bring our education 61:12 locally 61:19 we're going to repeal and replace that horror show called Obamacare 61:33 and we are going to save our Second Amendment 61:38 we
