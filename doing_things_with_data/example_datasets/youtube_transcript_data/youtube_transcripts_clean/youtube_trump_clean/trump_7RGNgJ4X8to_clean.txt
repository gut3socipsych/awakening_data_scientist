strong stronger than ever before irredeemable they don't talk 7:20 about that one but that was to me pretty bad i call you hard-working American 7:26 patriots you love your family and really really really love your country love 7:32 your color 7:36 yeah 7:42 yeah 7:44 yeah 7:45 yeah 7:50 Clinton's entire campaign rest are using a single tactic and it's not working 7:57 very well she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on phony campaign ads and 8:06 we're actually i think probably leading based on everything we're saying and 8:12 we've spent practically nothing i'm proud of that and you know what we're 8:20 doing very well you know the old days if you spent less and you had far fewer 8:26 people and you are leading you got credit today they say well she's 8:32 spending much more money yet but she's doing poorly very cool but what they do 8:37 is a spear opponents and you look at her history and a question policies and they 8:43 talk all the time about racist races the only were they know they used their own 8:48 Romney they used it on everybody they use it when the trouble they always pull 8:54 out the racist work and they are in very big trouble i have to tell you 9:02 and for the most part we haven't even started spending our money and we have 9:07 raised a lot of money and i'm putting in my money and i put in a hell of a lot of 9:12 money in fact if things don't work out even though a lot of people who say this 9:20 was one of the great political phenomenon they've ever seen 9:24 they've never seen the coat a phenomenal i will tell you if it doesn't work out 9:30 it will be a tremendous waste of time energy and money and she's angry for 9:37 even suggesting it but we're gonna look remember eight you go and vote we're 9:42 winning 9:43 I'll tell you what if you vote for women there's no way they could beat us there 9:49 is no way she can be just because her people have no enthusiasm whatsoever 9:55 they're not going to turn out they don't have the enthusiasm 10:00 who could possibly have enthusiasm what are you getting you turn out 10:07 we're winning big league and I think and they're all saying the drunk people are 10:11 going to turn out we have a movement like they have never ever seen in this 10:14 country 10:17 they say in terms of enthusiasm they have never had Poland higher so i think 10:26 i have heard of that turn out 10:29 we're gonna have a tremendous november eight probably will say november eight 10:35 plus the next four years and then four years after that okay 10:43 but the racist word it's the oldest play in the Democratic playbook and Americans 10:51 have had enough of it 10:52 ok we get it we get it i'll tell you what i just i told you i just left 10:58 little haiti the love is unbelievable it's unbelievable is no racist is no 11:05 nothing it's love 11:07 they want solutions they want better lives that more petty attacks from 11:12 failed and totally discredited politicians like crooked Hillary Clinton 11:19 they want their immigration laws enforced and their borders secured 11:42 what separates ok their patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want 11:51 their jobs and their families protected they want protection people warned about 11:58 radical Islamic terrorism are not Islamophobes everyone's in Islam befall 12:06 you mentioned something Europe Islamophobe you know they come up with 12:11 words hey I went to Ivy League school I did very well great to have so many new 12:18 words Islamophobe we have a president and frankly Hillary who don't use the 12:29 words radical Islamic terrorism and if you don't know what you're fighting 12:34 you're not gonna find it very well and we've proven that we have decent 12:41 American citizens the water were polled are tolerant values and keep our country 12:46 safe we want to keep our country safe people who support the police who want 12:52 crime reduced and ended and who are not prejudiced they're concerned and loving 13:00 citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is killed violently on 13:06 the streets which is happening all over our country yet while Hillary Clinton 13:12 lives behind gates and walls and guards and raises millions from hinge you know 13:18 look what she's doing with his hedge funds raising millions and millions i 13:21 know so many of these people give me a bridge 13:27 that's fun and the wall street donors she slanders and smears with her 13:33 statements last week working people who just want a fraction of the security 13:39 enjoyed by our politicians and certainly enjoyed by her now you know she's very 13:47 much against the Second Amendment she wants to destroy your second Amendment 13:54 guns guns guns right i think what we should do is she goes around with armed 14:02 bodyguards like you have never seen before I think that her bodyguards she 14:08 drop all weapons they should design but right i think they should disarm 14:14 immediately what do you think yes 14:16 yeah yeah take their guns away she doesn't want guns take their let's see 14:23 what happens to take their guns away 14:26 okay it'd be very dangerous 14:30 her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that letter to 14:37 violate federal law secretary of state hide and delete every means destroy our 14:42 iphones with a hammer with a hammer 14:47 15 14:52 but classified information in the reach of our enemies lie to Congress and 14:57 self-government favors and access through her foundation it's the same 15:04 attitude of applicants and entitlement that explains why she has never taken a 15:10 town of them for the disaster she created in Libya Syria Iraq aware and 15:17 all over the world everything she touched it just didn't work out 15:23 certainly it didn't work out for our country 15:26 it's just a reason why she won't take responsibility for central role in 15:32 unleashing Isis all over the world 15:39 her policies have created disaster overseas and poverty at home we say look 15:46 we see it I drove here we see it we see I'm running to reverse these values and 15:53 they are incredible failures and create a new American future and that future 16:02 begins with prosperity at home by economic agenda can be summed up in 16:11 three words and you can like these three words jobs jobs jobs 16:19 yeah 16:22 one of my highest priorities is to bring jobs into our inner cities 16:26 african-american communities have suffered horribly as a result of failed 16:32 Democratic leadership Democrats have run these inner cities for a half a century 16:38 for 60 years 75 years even in some cases a hundred years straight unabated 16:46 unbroken over a hundred years they control the mayor's offices the school 16:52 board's the City Council's and the seats in Congress and all they have to live is 16:57 more poverty more crime and more failing schools sixty-five percent of 17:05 african-american children under the age of six now live in poverty 17:15 more than 3,000 people have been shot in the city of Chicago this year this year 17:25 think of it since january first fifty-eight percent of african-american 17:30 youth are not working can get a job 17:34 these are the results of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton and everyone 17:40 knows that if she's elected the inner cities will get nothing but more pain 17:46 and suffering and crime and Harding 18:20 yeah 18:22 yeah 18:25 yeah 18:28 amazing people amazing country we have an amazing country and obviously you see 18:34 the crimes that sense you're african-american you have the inner-city 18:39 problems that have been going on for ever forever you have problems like 18:45 nobody has and you look at crying you look at schools you look at no jobs 18:51 look at the worst education look at dangers you can't walk down the street 18:56 you get shot for your child gets shot and I've been saying it now saying 19:01 openly and some people like it and some people don't like it and I don't really 19:05 care 19:09 what do you have to lose 19:12 I will fix it I'm gonna fix it we're going to fix our inner cities we're 19:17 gonna make them safe 19:18 we're gonna bring jobs back so to the african-american people within the 19:23 community what do you have to lose it can't get honestly it can't get that 19:29 sonus thank you 19:30 it can't get any worse it can't get any worse it can't get any worse 19:42 thank you 19:51 so nice thank you thank you very much it can't get any worse the crime the jobs 19:58 no jobs no education worst education more unsafe you got Afghanistan right 20:05 we're Afghanistan 20:07 I mean we have cities that are far more dangerous than Afghanistan inner cities 20:12 african-american people within that community and outside of that community 20:20 are going to be voting for Donald Trump in record numbers who are we gonna fix 20:26 it 20:29 Hillary Clinton has been in Washington for 30 years her disastrous record 20:36 speaks for itself and i have to tell you what she ran for the United States 20:42 Senate in New York we have upstate New York which is a total disaster economic 20:46 disaster 20:47 she said she's gonna bring back jobs jobs jobs see anyone she gets elected we 20:52 lost our jobs we got worse she didn't do anything she didn't do anything you want 21:00 you want to sleep okay 21:02 she doing she didn't do anything 21:05 it got worse far worse now it's a total catastrophe 21:10 just remember that when she tells you about jobs when she tells you she's 21:14 gonna fixed-rate tears she wouldn't know where to begin 21:17 she wouldn't know where to begin and besides that to do that kind of thing to 21:22 negotiate great trade deals to really enhance I'm gonna let me look 21:27 our military is so depleted we have the greatest people on earth the using 21:33 equipment that's all they're flying planes are all you see what's happening 21:37 it's a depleted military we have to have a strong military we have to take care 21:43 of our vets we have to take care of 21:47 but they're do these things you need a lot of energy and she does not have the 21:55 energy and in my opinion she is totally unfit to be the president of the united 22:01 states the only people that you will deliver for frankly our her donors and 22:10 her special interest i'm going to deliver for you believe me 22:16 the American people we're going to deliver you're going to be happy and 22:19 those inner cities are going to see progress like they have probably not 22:23 probably like they have never seen you watch like to have ever seen 22:31 thank you it would love our taxes and we're getting a massive tax reduction 22:38 and by the way Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes substantially 22:47 if we remove destructive regulations at least the vast treasure of American 22:53 energy we have so much energy 22:55 it's being destroyed our economic worth and negotiate trade deals that put 23:02 America first then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the 23:08 amount of prosperity we can unleash there is no limit pay off our debt pay 23:14 down our debt reduce taxes get rid of regulations my first day in office i'm 23:21 going to order a review of every single regulation issue over the last 10 years 23:28 needless job-killing regulations will be immediately cancelled millions of new 23:38 jobs will comparing in and we're going to lift the restrictions on American 23:44 energy which means at least another half a million jobs each year they are being 23:50 destroyed and we're unable to compete with other nations very simple and 23:58 that's just the beginning also on my first day i'm going to ask Congress to 24:04 send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disasters Obamacare has turned 24:10 out to be a disaster 24:14 yeah 24:17 yeah 24:23 it's along with is simply save another two million jobs and if you look at your 24:29 premiums it's through the roof and by the way in november first just before 24:35 the election in November a new numbers are coming out which will show forty 24:40 fifty sixty percent increases they want to delay it till after the election 24:45 because its election it's it's a disaster 24:50 it's a disaster add your deductibles are so high that unless you lead a really 24:58 long slow vicious death 25:02 you're never going to be able to use you see the deductibles you're never going 25:07 to be able to use it but also going to completely reformed our trade is we're 25:14 going to renegotiate NAFTA probably the worst trade deal ever agreed to sign in 25:24 the history of the world not in the United States its destroyed our 25:29 manufacturing in our country it's destroyed and by the way guess who 25:34 signed it Bill Clinton 25:39 you look at all of the places Florida included but you look at upstate New 25:44 York you look at Ohio you look at pennsylvania you look at all of these 25:48 different places have been destroyed 25:51 absolutely destroyed you look at new england look what happened to New 25:55 England they've been destroyed by companies moving out going into Mexico 26:00 firing everybody unemployment through the roof 26:04 we're going to stand up to China and keep America out of the trance Pacific 26:10 Partnership another catastrophe 26:17 DP will be almost as bad as NAFTA nothing can be as bad as NAFTA 26:24 trans-pacific partnership will be almost as bad as NAFTA it'll take you jobs Ohio 26:31 remember it's going to take your jobs Ohio I tell you that Michigan so many 26:37 places TPP is a disaster 26:41 we don't need another massive multinational deal by the way that 26:46 nobody in our side even reads that ties us up and bind just down and doesn't 26:53 even discuss monetary manipulation and evaluation which is how China and all 27:00 these countries are beating us so badly not even discussed and they had 27:06 provisions in the agreement and they were taken out because certain 27:13 politicians didn't want to have them in there 27:15 I wonder why another major reform is going to be school choice and we're 27:26 gonna terminate common core and we're bringing our education local 27:35 I . flying to plan to provide every disadvantage child in America the 27:40 freedom to choose the private-public magnet or religious school of his or her 27:46 choice 27:48 this one lift millions of four african-american and hispanic children 27:54 out of poverty something we are going to do since president obama came into 27:59 office another two million Hispanic Americans have fallen into poverty its 28:05 catastrophic and it's totally unacceptable to the Hispanic community I 28:10 say we are going to protect your jobs 28:14 we're going to build up your schools and we're going to deliver safety and 28:18 opportunity for your children you have no safety you have little opportunity 28:22 this week i also rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get 28:33 affordable quality child care for their children child care 28:37 he wanted some very much for child she's been thinking about that to me for two 28:43 years long before I even decided to go through this journey and it's not easy i 28:49 want to tell you we speak in rooms like this this is about a hundred degrees 28:53 right now that's considered a cool auditorium and the reason is we have 28:59 such big crowds like this one look at every single quarter 29:02 unbelievable 29:05 these rooms weren't designed for this many people and it is hot in these 29:12 around and we send up here and we talked and we do two or three and sometimes 29:17 will be hitting for a day do you think Hillary Clinton can get through one gets 29:27 here 18-minute speaks bom bom-bom sia see I'm going home now we're doing it 29:39 the right way and frankly when they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on 29:43 advertising I don't have to because i do it the old-fashioned way I come into 29:47 your neighborhood lot cheaper so I to work but it's a lot cheaper 29:57 very 30:00 yeah 30:01 very cool on policy after policy 30:06 we're going to provide opportunity prosperity and security for all 30:10 Americans 30:11 we're also going to stand with the Cuban people in their fight against communist 30:17 oppression 30:22 now we're on the we're on the right side great people great people 30:31 the president's one-sided deal for Cuba and with Cuba benefits only the castro 30:40 regime 30:47 people are very unhappy about it you know was interesting when he landed the 30:52 plane recently in china right 30:56 they refused to give myself away out of Air Force One now that is a first in the 31:01 history of Air Force One 31:03 so he's basically the mechanics stairs 31:06 that's the stair they drop down to get the mechanics up to fix the light ball 31:10 breath when he landed the plane in saudi arabia which we protect without us they 31:19 wouldn't be there for two months he landed in Saudi Arabia he wasn't greeted 31:24 by the top of fishes now what I have done in those two cases bomb cake we got 31:33 to watch it Jim let's go 31:40 yeah 31:42 let's go Jim get going closed doors were going on with Cuba with Cuba we land in 31:53 Cuba and there's no castro google the big leaders weren't there to greet him 32:04 and I have a lot of Cuban friends but you would have all done the same thing 32:10 again Jim let's close those doors we're going home right right let's go captain 32:18 we're going home we're going into Washington maybe walk into miami 32:24 actually that's not a bad parent that's 33 Saudi Arabia Cuba china air force one 32:38 has never been treated so badly it's long and incredible history Air Force 32:45 One used to land and people would respect the people inside and then come 32:50 out and that be all sorts of poop la not anymore 32:55 unbelievable and these are countries that have benefited by else greatly so 33:00 we have to make great deals before we do anything with Cuba or anybody else right 33:07 we're going to make craters you'll be happy you're gonna be happy i tell you 33:11 how many people from Cuba can be a topic Cupid good if we would meet you agree 33:17 we'll do it but we'll do it with great deals and we're doing with democracy and 33:24 we'll do it the way we have to do it okay 33:30 we'll do it the right way where is Miss Delgado does everybody know what a great 33:37 where is she is so amazing 33:40 AJ where's agent while she's so she's become a tremendous star tell you one 33:46 thing when she's representing me I wouldn't do it anyway but i can turn off 33:51 the television 33:52 I'm well protected thank you great job thank you very much thank you angel but 34:01 all of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the castro regime were done 34:08 through executive order which means the next president can reverse them and that 34:13 I will do unless the castro regime meet our demands of my demands our domains 34:21 you know what the demands are those demands will include religious and 34:26 political freedom for the Cuban people and the free of political prisoners the 34:35 free of political prism 34:39 right now am i up is that right 34:46 boy oh boy what energy in this room 34:49 what energy 34:54 a lot of energy 35:08 will be very happy my Cuban friends I have so many friends from Cuba 35:13 incredible people so let's also talk about a place called Venezuela bang here 35:22 from Venezuela or related some not too many wall 35:28 whoa what's going on not too many not too many friend or foe I think he's 35:33 friend I think he's 35:41 nice ok is okay by the way is there anyplace more fun to be that a trump 35:49 rally eww 35:55 do we have a lot of Venezuelans around around the doral section right and it's 36:01 a beautiful vibrant this is an amazing place but they are really having trouble 36:08 over in Venezuela but Miami is filled with hard-working incredible Venezuelan 36:17 people but it's been hurt very badly by socialists Venezuela and the next 36:23 president of the United States must stand in solidarity with all people 36:28 oppressed in our hemisphere and we will stand with oppressed people and there 36:34 are many the oppressed people of Venezuela they are yearning to be free 36:39 they are yearning for help 36:42 the system is bad but the people are great great they are great people here 36:51 in America push to expand freedom for all of our citizens i'm going to lower 36:56 your taxes so substantially we're getting rid of all of those regulations 37:04 for business so many small business owners who I know I've of them one of 37:09 them were small business now is big business are proud of his right here but 37:14 we're going to get rid of those terrible terrible regulations he just said to me 37:19 and to think that surprises me most 37:22 we're bringing business tax rates down from thirty-five percent of fifteen 37:26 percent and yet it will be the greatest cut i believe in the history of our 37:32 country but i will tell you what surprises be tremendously is that the 37:39 people that have these cuts they're more concerned with regulations and even a 37:43 big tax decrease because regulations are choking and killing our businesses and 37:48 stopping our businesses from hiring people jobs 37:54 so I'm going to appoint justices of the Supreme Court who will follow the 38:05 Constitution 38:11 I'm going to retail our depleted milk gonna take care of our veterans that's 38:19 who's that who's that 38:22 where my vets we're ok now they're standing now there i know we had a lot 38:31 of vets here 38:33 thank you fellas thank you very much we're going to take care of our vets 38:38 we're going to save your second Amendment you know if you look at some 38:43 of the things the catastrophes you look at orlando you look at san bernardino 38:48 you look at so many different you look at paris the toughest gun laws in the 38:52 world they have it repairs these drugs these animals walked in and they just go 38:58 bom-bom-bom nobody had guns on the other side if there were guns on the other 39:06 side just a few of them number one probably if they knew they wouldn't have 39:11 attacked and number two even if they did attack it would have been a whole 39:16 different story hundred thirty people killed people massively injured still in 39:21 the hospital their lives are just destroyed and if they had protection if 39:28 they had guns on the other side with the bullets lying the other direction would 39:31 be a whole different story 39:33 so we're going to protect your second and i'm going to stop illegal 39:37 immigration and drugs from coming into our country and yes we will 39:44 they all 39:44 a wall you will build a wall 39:51 we will build a wall 40:10 who's gonna pay for the wall 100-percent 100 crystal and we're going to be 40:21 renegotiating afton are terrible trade deals 40:24 we're going to make great deals out of horrible deals and if we can't 40:28 renegotiate the deal because the other side is so so happy with it 40:34 we're going to terminate the deal and we'll start all over again folks will 40:38 have new deals and they'll be much better deals and they'll be two-way 40:42 streets the Prophet it'll be coming our way 40:45 it's a one-way street out of the United States for our jobs and our money you 40:50 know I always say we get the drugs they get the cash that's the deal folks no 40:55 good they're building in Mexico right now in Mexico is just one example some 41:01 of the greatest plants a friend of my bills plants and he tells me all the 41:05 time i called him up the other day I call them up six months ago told me the 41:09 same thing nothing changes for they just announced yesterday they're moving their 41:15 small car division the whole thing into Mexico that's on top of spending 41:20 billions and billions of dollars and then you wonder why i'm winning in 41:25 Michigan because I've been telling the people in Michigan I've been telling the 41:29 people in Ohio for five years if this is happening and our politicians don't do 41:34 anything about it and Hillary Clinton will never do anything about it she 41:38 doesn't have the capability to do it we will rebuild our roads and bridges 41:44 tunnels
