0:01 thank you what a group Wow beautiful thank you 0:18 thank you everybody thank you it's great to be here tonight I'm honored also to 0:27 be joined this evening by Governor Scott Walker great gentleman and a great a 0:33 really great governor chairman rights brevis and mirror Rudolph Giuliani we're 0:43 at a decisive moment in this election last week I laid out my plan to bring 0:50 jobs back to our country desperately needed jobs yesterday I laid out my plan 0:57 to defeat radical Islamic terrorism tonight i'm going to talk about how to 1:07 make our communities safe again from crime and lawlessness let me begin by 1:15 thanking law enforcement officers here in this city and across this country for 1:21 their service and sacrifice in difficult difficult difficult times 1:30 the violence riots and destruction that have taken place in Milwaukee is an 1:37 assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and to live in peace 1:43 law and order must be restored it must be restored for the sake of all but most 2:00 especially for the sake of those living in the affected communities of which 2:05 there are many the main victims of these riots are law-abiding african-american 2:13 citizens living in these neighborhoods it's their job 2:18 it's their homes it's their schools and communities which will suffer the most 2:24 as a result there's no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct for anyone 2:37 crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a 2:43 trump administration the narrative has been pushed aggressively for years and 2:53 now by our current administration and pushed by my opponent Hillary Clinton 2:59 you know is a totally false one you know that the problem in our poorest 3:08 communities is not that there are too many police 3:12 the problem is that there are not enough police more law enforcement more 3:20 community engagement more effective policing is what our country needs 3:25 desperately just like Hillary Clinton is against the miners she is against the 3:33 police believe me 3:37 you know it and I know it and guess what she knows it 3:44 those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society and 3:49 narrative supported with a not by my opponent share directly in the 3:55 responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee and many other places within 4:01 our country they have fostered the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in 4:09 America and all throughout America every time we rush to judgment with false 4:16 facts and narratives weather in Ferguson or Baltimore and foment further unrest 4:22 we do a direct deservin stupor african american residents who are hurt by the 4:29 high crime in their community a big big unfair problem during the last 72 hours 4:39 while protesters have raged against the police here in Milwaukee another nine 4:45 were killed in chicago and another 46 were wounded more than 2,600 people have 4:54 been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year and almost 4,000 people 5:00 killed in President Obama's hometown area since his presidency began not too 5:08 good 5:09 that's for sure 5:14 so how are we serving these American victims by attacking law enforcement 5:18 officers the war or our police must end and it must end now 5:39 thank you 5:42 the warrant police is a worn all peaceful citizens who want to be able to 5:49 work and live and send their kids to school in safety 5:54 our job is not to make life more comfortable for the writer or the robber 5:59 or the loser or the violent disrupter of which there are many 6:04 our job is to make life more comfortable for the african-american parent who 6:09 wants their kids to be able to safely safely walk the streets and walk to 6:14 school or the senior citizen waiting for a bus or the young child walking home 6:20 from school for everyone violent protester there are a hundred moms and 6:26 dads and kids are the same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely 6:32 at night they want safety 6:41 my opponent Hillary would rather protect the offender than the victim big problem 6:50 in our society Hillary Clinton back policies are responsible for the 6:56 problems in the inner cities today and they vote for her is a vote for another 7:01 generation of poverty high crime and lost opportunities i care too much about 7:09 my country to let this happen 7:21 yeah 7:22 the fact is we all care too much about our country to let this happen 7:34 good policing saves lives 7:40 my wonderful friend who you just heard Rudy Giuliani knows a thing or two about 7:46 this 7:47 he's done an amazing job the policies put into place by rudy ultimately 7:52 brought down crime by seventy-six percent and murder by eighty-four 7:58 percent in New York 8:02 think of how many families were saved how much heartache was prevented when 8:08 police were put into communities and criminals were automatically and 8:13 systematically removed imagine how many lives could have been saved all across 8:20 this country if Democratic politicians had blocked in their cities what Rudy 8:26 did in New York City 8:29 I'll make sure we deliver safe neighborhoods here in Milwaukee and 8:33 Milwaukee has got so many problems so many problems 8:38 the world is watching right here in Milwaukee but also across the country 8:45 it's easy for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to crime when she has her own 8:50 private security force that by the way carries guns Second Amendment 9:01 i believe all Americans not just a powerful are entitled to security 9:08 Hillary Clinton has had her chance she's failed at so many things 9:14 almost everything she's done now it's time for new leadership the Hillary 9:20 Clinton agenda hurts poor people by far the most there is no compassion and 9:26 allowing drug dealers gang members and felons to prey on innocent people 9:38 it is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe and when I'm 9:44 president I will fight for the safety of every American and especially those 9:50 Americans who have not known safety for a very very long time 10:03 I'm asking for the vote of every African American citizen struggling in our 10:11 country today who wants a different and much better future 10:19 it's time for our society to address some honest and very very difficult to 10:26 the Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the african-american community 10:32 Democratic crime policies education policies and economic policies have 10:39 produced only more crime more broken homes and more poverty let us look at 10:50 the situation right here at milwaukee a city-run by Democrats for a decade after 10:56 decade last year killings in this city increased by sixty-nine percent plus 11:03 another 634 victims of non-fatal shootings 18 to 29 year-olds accounted 11:12 for nearly half of the homicide victims the poverty rate here is nearly double 11:18 the national average almost four intend african-american men of Milwaukee 11:23 between the ages of 25 and 50 for do not have a job nearly four intense 11:32 single-mother households are living in poverty 55 public schools in the city 11:38 have been rated as failing to meet expectations despite ten thousand 11:44 dollars in funding per pupil which is a very very high number 11:49 there's only a 60-percent graduation rate and it's one of the worst public 11:54 school systems anywhere in the country one and five manufacturing jobs has 12:00 disappeared in Milwaukee since we fully opened our markets and you understand 12:05 what that means we open these markets to China and many african-american 12:11 neighborhoods have burned half look they have suffered we opened our markets 12:16 they've taken our 12:17 jobs they give us our products that we don't make anymore and african-american 12:23 neighborhoods along with many other neighborhoods have suffered greatly to 12:29 every voter in Milwaukee to every voter living in the inner city or every 12:36 forgotten stretch of our society 12:38 I'm running to offer you a much better future a much better job 12:52 and a much higher wage 12:58 thank you 13:01 thank you the democratic party is taking the votes of african-americans for 13:07 granted 13:08 they've just assume they'll get your support and done nothing in return for 13:13 it 13:14 they've taken advantage of the African American citizen 13:19 it's time to give the Democrats some competition for these votes and it's 13:24 time to rebuild the inner cities of America and to reject the failed 13:29 leadership of a rig political system and that's what it is it's a rigged system 13:38 I'm not part of the corrupt system in fact the corrupt system is trying to 13:45 stop me 13:46 I've been paying my own way 13:50 tens of millions of dollars tens of millions of dollars the voters in the 13:57 Republican Party this year defied the donors the consultants the power brokers 14:02 and chose a nominee from outside our failed and corrupt broken system the 14:08 nominee is me 14:18 the other party the democratic party nominated the personification of special 14:24 interest corruption the Democratic Party rig the nomination to give it to Hillary 14:31 Clinton does giving the soul of their party this year to special interests 14:37 what else is new 14:38 I'm running to listen to your voice to hear the cries for help from so many 14:47 people in our nation the quiet voices in our society not the loudest 14:54 demonstrators need to have their demands heard 15:04 jobs safety opportunity fair and equal representation we reject the bigotry of 15:13 Hillary Clinton which pandas to and talks down to communities of color and 15:19 sees them only as votes that's all they care about 15:23 not as individual human beings worthy of a better future 15:28 they have taken advantage 15:34 she doesn't care at all about the hurting people of this country or the 15:39 suffering she has caused them and she meaning she and her party officials 15:46 there has been tremendous suffering because of what they have brought the 15:52 african-american community has been taken for granted for decades by the 15:57 Democratic Party and look how they're doing 16:01 it's time to break with the failures of the past i want to offer Americans a new 16:07 and much better future 16:09 it's time for ruled by the people not rule for the special interest which we 16:15 have right now 16:21 thank you every inside getting rich off our broken system and it is broken is 16:30 throwing money at Hillary Rodham Clinton 16:37 the hedge fund managers the Wall Street investors the professional political 16:43 class it's the powerful protecting only the powerful they don't care about you 16:50 believe me 16:51 insiders fighting for insiders but I'm fighting for you that's what I'm doing 17:02 when we talk about the insider who we talking about 17:06 it's the comfortable politicians looking out for their own interests 17:10 it's the lobbyists to know how to insert that perfect loophole into every single 17:16 bill and get richer and richer and richer at your expense 17:22 it's the financial industry that knows how to regulate the competition right 17:27 out of existence so there is no competition the insiders also include 17:33 the media executives anchors and journalists in Washington los angeles 17:40 and new york city who are part of the same failed status quo and what nothing 17:47 to change they don't want it to change they liked it just fine the way it is 17:52 now every day you pick up a newspaper or turn on the nightly news and you hear 17:58 about some self-interest banker or some self discredited Washington insider say 18:05 they oppose Donald Trump's campaign but you don't oppose it that I can tell you 18:16 here on opposing thank you thank you very much 18:31 great honor it's a great honor and you have three times as many people standing 18:35 outside trying to get in so I just want to tell you thank you 18:39 amazing foursome encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign 18:49 or some big-time lobbies days they oppose the campaign of Trump I where 18:56 there are position as a badge of honor 19:04 because it means I'm fighting for real change not just partisan change where 19:11 everybody else gets rich but you a rigged rigged system remember it I said 19:17 it first i'll probably be saying it for a long time but eventually we're gonna 19:22 break that system 19:31 I'm fighting all of us across the country fighting for peaceful regime 19:37 change in our own country the media donor political complex that's blood 19:43 this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of By and For the 19:50 People 20:00 the leadership clash in washington DC of which Hillary Clinton has been a member 20:06 for 30 years has abandoned the people of this country they care about themselves 20:16 they only care about themselves 20:21 i am going to give the people their voice back 20:25 think about it the people opposing our campaign are the same people who have 20:34 left our border open and let innocent people suffer as a result including vast 20:41 amounts of crime vast amounts of drugs pouring into our country and poisoning 20:47 our youth and our people the people opposing our campaign are the same 20:54 people who have led us into one disastrous foreign war after another one 21:00 after another 21:02 no wins no victory no nothing 21:05 the people opposing our campaign are the same people who lied to us about one 21:12 trade deal after another they keep getting worse aren't you tired of a 21:17 system that gets rich at your expense because that's what's happening 21:24 our new tire of big media big businesses and big donors rigging the system to 21:34 keep your voice from being heard 21:37 are you ready for change 21:45 are you ready for leadership that puts you the American people first together 21:51 first 21:54 that puts your country first America first remember that America first 22:00 America first America first 22:09 let's talk about what this means for the inner cities of America a big big 22:14 problem unsolved for ever 22:18 it's time to break through the television noise the entrenched 22:23 interests which are just decimating our country and our inner cities i 22:29 understand that a lot of powerful people are in our political system a lot of 22:33 people who've created our problems will lose a lot of their contracts and a lot 22:38 of their money if african-american voters and all the minority voters 22:43 support my campaign that I know that I know for sure it's time to stop making 22:51 the special interests rich it's time to make the American people much richer 22:59 than they've ever been before 23:07 i'm going to make America wealthy again we have to make America wealthy again if 23:13 we're going to do what we want to do we have to be smart 23:16 we have to make America wealthy again the Democratic Party has run nearly 23:22 every inner city in this country for 50 years and run them into financial ruin 23:30 virtually every single one they've ruined the school's they've driven out 23:35 the jobs they have tolerated a level of crime no American should consider 23:39 acceptable worse than many third world countries so bad that people don't want 23:45 to even reporter and the real numbers are beyond belief violent crime has 23:50 risen seventeen percent in America's 50 largest cities last year killings of 23:58 police officers this year is up nearly fifty percent homicides are up more than 24:05 sixty percent in Baltimore alone there up more than fifty percent in washington 24:11 DC this is the future offered by the policies of Hillary Clinton and her 24:18 friends more poverty more crime and basically just more of the same 24:28 the future she offers is the most pessimistic thing I could possibly 24:35 imagine it's time for a different future here is what I'm proposing first on 24:41 immigration no community in this country has been hurt worse by hillary clinton's 24:47 immigration and all of her policies than the african-american community and she 24:54 considers them a guaranteed vote now she is proposing to print instant work 25:00 permits for millions of illegal immigrants to come in and take 25:05 everybody's job including low-income african-americans not right not gonna 25:13 happen i will secure our border protect our workers and improve our jobs and 25:20 wages in your community 25:21 we're going to improve our wages are going to improve our jobs and we're not 25:26 going to let companies leave our country so quickly and so easily for other lands 25:32 and then take their products and sell it to us 25:36 not gonna happen 25:41 we will only invite people to join our country who share our tolerance values 25:49 who support our Constitution and who love all of our people they love our 25:55 people they have to love our country or what are we doing on train i'm going to 26:07 renegotiate NAFTA one of the worst trade deals ever sign in the history of our 26:14 country perhaps the worst ever signed in the history frankly of the world 26:20 we're going to stand up to China withdraw from TPP which is another 26:24 disaster and protect every last American job we are going to protect every last 26:34 American job which were not doing now on taxes i'm going to give a massive tax 26:43 cut to every worker in small business in this country bring thousands of new 26:48 companies and millions of new jobs on to our shores and make it very difficult 26:54 for our businesses to leave it will be a costly proposition for them to fire 27:01 everybody and leave 27:06 I'm going to reform our regulations so job say in America and new businesses 27:14 come to America to hire workers even right here in Milwaukee every policy my 27:24 opponent has sends jobs outside of the country and overseas i'm going to bring 27:30 trillions and new wealth back into the United States our education 27:35 believe me you look at our education it's time to have school choice merit 27:42 pay for teachers and to end the tenure policies that hurt good teachers and 27:47 reward bad teachers 27:56 yeah 27:58 and there is no job more important than a good teacher please remember that 28:03 there is no job more important we are going to put students and parents first 28:12 Hillary Clinton would rather deny opportunities to millions of young 28:17 african-american children just so she can curry favor with the education 28:23 bureaucracy which is very big and a lot of votes i am going to allow charter 28:30 schools to thrive and help young kids get on the American ladder of success a 28:36 good education and a good paying job that's what they want 28:45 on crime i am going to support more police in our communities a . the best 28:52 prosecutors and judges in the country pursue strong enforcement of federal 28:57 laws and I'm going to break up the gangs the cartels and the criminal syndicates 29:05 terrorizing our neighborhoods all over the country and that includes Milwaukee 29:18 to every law breaker hurting innocent people in this country i say you're free 29:23 reign will soon come crashing to an end on healthcare we're going to get rid of 29:33 Obamacare repeal it and replace it 29:39 it's cause our adoptable digit premium increases and we're going to give choice 29:46 to patients and to consumers across our land 29:50 aetna just today announced that they're dropping out as are many of the major 29:54 insurance companies Obamacare is a disaster a disaster on government 30:02 corruption i'm going to restore honor to our government we've seen the corruption 30:08 of Hillary Clinton the mass email don't look at what's going on folks look at 30:15 what's going on the mass email deletions have you seen the 33,000 deletions the 30:26 pay for playing at the State Department the profiteering the favors given to 30:32 foreign corporations and governments at your expense and taxpayers expense and 30:37 it's not acceptable any longer its corrupt we've seen a former Secretary of 30:48 State lie to Congress about her illegal email scheme risk innocent American 30:54 lives and bring dishonor on to our government great great dishonor in my 31:02 administration i'm going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of 31:08 classified information those laws are already protected we thought but perhaps 31:14 everybody is wrong 31:16 perhaps all of those that have served jail time were wrong 31:21 she got special favors and nobody has ever seen anything like it in the 31:27 history of our country 31:35 no one will be above the law 31:39 i am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by 31:45 preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when 31:51 they serve 31:56 i am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking 32:04 fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving 32:09 office or from any entity tied to a foreign government 32:15 what's happening is disgraceful 32:21 this is all just the beginning we are going to make this a government of the 32:26 people once again this is our chance 32:31 This Is It this is it the last chance this is our chance to take back power 32:37 from all the people who've taken it from you over so many years the reason you 32:44 see the establishment and the establishment media lining up behind my 32:49 opponent is because they are scared that you with your vote can take away their 32:55 power and return it to your family and to your community 33:07 and they are scared and they have no idea how many people on november eight 33:13 are going to come out and vote 33:21 ok 33:26 thank you thank you 33:30 these are tough times but I know we can make America greater than
