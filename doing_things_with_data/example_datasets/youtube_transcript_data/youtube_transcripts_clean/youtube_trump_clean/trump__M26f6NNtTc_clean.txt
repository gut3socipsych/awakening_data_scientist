0:00 trumpet 12 crews at six Rubio at one that being a minute to set a caucus from 0:08 from from Tuesday night and 12 state yet again you know still lit a fire as a 0:15 front-runner status when you're going into the rust belt in Michigan and Ohio 0:21 a couple days after that men down into florida which is really become his 0:26 second state as his second home with his properties has golf courses his holdings 0:31 in in Florida and you know he loves to spend the weekend at mar-a-lago in Palm 0:36 Beach yeah it's definitely a second home he feels like he's got a very good shot 0:40 in Florida and the numbers indicate that he has done very well larry was up by 19 0:45 percent and clearly the attention is gonna start return to Florida and Ohio 0:48 we hear them saying to the press in the room to take their seats this evening 0:52 just to mention as we go to this Marco Rubio important Rico tonight arguing 0:56 that he never expected this part of the race to look good for him that he thinks 1:00 it will look better 1:01 going down the home stretch but it's becoming a tough argument there as we 1:05 expect that mr. Trump will be taking the podium momentarily for us in the press 1:10 to sit down and get ready 1:11 the delegate count is what matters in the end and it's worth repeating 1:16 these numbers will 1:17 look like they're basically you've got down from 350 or slightly north of that 1:21 which gives him roughly a hundred point lead over Ted Cruz an easy game out the 1:27 competition 1:28 various states they're still yet to voter caucus you can see how did so 1:32 called case under proportional 1:34 how difficult it is when you're in second place trying to catch the leader 1:38 there is however 1:41 success and that is March 15 then that is what our take on Ohio and winner 1:46 takes all 1:47 Ted Cruz today announced 1:49 he will open 10 statewide offices in Florida and he's gonna do it 1:55 in the i-4 corridor is gonna do it in jacksonville north east 1:59 the Panhandle or I expect frankly donald Trump to do very well and he will do it 2:04 in the southwestern areas like Sarasota 2:07 he is that a chance for Ted Cruz the slide in between Rubio 2:13 the 15th of March 2:18 and I and my sense is Angelica Angelica and 2:26 and places he set up his headquarters are in the right places let's get very 2:30 smart political operatives in this case 2:32 and I don't think he's got a big media campaign 2:36 global player in those 10 media markets he stars just as it is 2:44 States mr. Donald J 3:16 great club and a great success and we appreciated have so many of our members 3:36 beautiful it's been a really an amazing night and I'll tell you what I've been 3:41 in competitions all of my life there is nothing so exciting is the stuff not the 3:49 wedding bells are winning club championships or whatever you want to 3:55 say there's nothing like this it's really exciting stuff and very important 4:00 above all else it's very very important so I want to thank the people of 4:05 Louisiana the people of Kentucky it's been just an amazing relations amazing 4:13 relationship and Rand Paul is senator in kentucky fried very very hard today and 4:19 for the last number of weeks fighting us every inch of the way and we won and we 4:24 won by quite a few votes under a very happy about it 4:27 thank you to louisiana and thank you to kentucky I want to really thank the 4:34 folks from maine and from kansas we came in second and we really didn't spend 4:40 very much time we spent two hours in one place and two and a half hours and the 4:45 other and we came in with a strong second so I want to thank those folks 4:50 and I want to congratulate Ted on main and cancers and he should do well in May 4:56 because it's very close to capitalist faced with that 5:00 had a very very bad night 5:15 personally I'd call for him to drop out of the race I think it's time now that 5:19 he dropped out of the rest I think it's probably time you know I don't think 5:26 tonight he can get up and rant and rave and he did great he comes in 30 comes 5:30 and fought every time he comes in third of what he says you gotta be able to win 5:34 and he has not been able to win and I think it's time that he dropped out I 5:38 would love to take on dead one on one that would be so much fun because take 5:43 care when New York and New Jersey can't win pennsylvania it can't win california 5:48 I wanted one-on-one ok I think one of the reasons we did so well tonight and 5:59 so strong is that we did you know we really had a good debate I think we did 6:04 very well I just hit from every side every angle that you could be had from a 6:08 very viciously actually but I think we did very well in the debate I do say 6:12 this were marching along and they were doing very well in florida today was in 6:17 Orlando we had a group of at least 20,000 people we had a sent 10,000 6:25 people away at the place was packed and it was an amazing day and I love the 6:31 people of Florida it's my second home where in Florida tonight and I just want 6:36 to thank you for being just incredible and i'm looking at the poll numbers 6:42 even though I've never seen any human being hit with more negative commercials 6:49 and I'm being hit with outfit I no human being should have to have forty million 6:55 dollars spent on negative commercials and despite that we have a tremendous 6:59 leader in Florida and hopefully will do very well I think we're going to do very 7:02 well in Ohio I worked when I was a young guy at swift in the village and 7:07 Cincinnati and I think that we're gonna do fantastically in Ohio I love that 7:12 state I love the people of the state so hopefully we're gonna do very well 7:15 they're the biggest story in all of politics isn't even what's happening 7:20 tonight and on super tuesday but the biggest story is the tremendous 7:24 outpouring of voters coming into the republican party you seeing what's 7:29 happening and 7:35 millions of people are coming in and voting and they've never seen anything 7:41 like it before actually they're doing covers on time magazine because it's a 7:46 movement what's happening as a movement and I'm very honored just say that if I 7:50 were not involved that wouldn't be happening while I'm not kidding but I'll 7:55 say I'm kidding because I want them to say I'm a nice person but the interview 8:00 talking about millions and millions of people and we have a dynamic party and 8:06 as a party we should come together and stop this foolishness 8:10 you know we have something and I was thinking about it today for the first 8:12 time the establishment is very unhappy with the way things are going and I can 8:17 understand that although I used to be part of the establishment you know seven 8:20 months ago before I decided to run I was part of the establishment but now I'm 8:25 not part of the establishment once announce that is running this ad what's 8:28 he doing why is he running he's supposed to be running we want people that we can 8:32 control we want people that we can give money to so that if we want something 8:36 for pharmaceuticals or for electric utilities or lumber or chrome oil and 8:42 gas we have total control over a senator or a congressman so you know I'm 8:47 self-funding I'm not taking their money they have no control I'm gonna do what's 8:51 right for the american people and that's her son so they're not happy but i was 8:58 thinkin today because I love the Republican Party and I love the 9:03 conservatives that I love a lot of people that are very good friends of 9:07 mine and I've been a member for a long time but today I was thinking for the 9:11 first time really thinking about this we lost a great man justice scalia he needs 9:19 to be replaced and you can only replace him with somebody truly great he can 9:23 never be replaced he was really something very very good friend of my 9:28 sister was a federal judge and the court of appeals and highly respected and we 9:35 have and that was totally unexpected it just shows what happens 9:38 totally unexpected so we have a situation with it now saying wow maybe 9:43 we're not going to be able to be trumped the normal way 9:46 so will run a third-party candidate and maybe we can get on all the states will 9:51 do enough that it's impossible for Donald Trump to win because we're going 9:56 to appoint me going to appoint a conservative great judge high intellect 10:03 very conservative something that will make the people in the republican party 10:08 very happy someone that will make the people very happy if they run a third 10:15 party or an independent party if they do that it will make it impossible for the 10:20 Republican candidate on the assumption it's me or anybody to when it's that 10:26 means losing that means that hillary Clinton who should not be allowed to run 10:31 because of what she did with the emails should not be allowed to run on the 10:42 assumption that they did that it would be impossible for the Republican to win 10:46 and obviously the independent or third-party could not win so the 10:51 democrats would have an absolute three-run probably you wouldn't even 10:55 campaign because it would be impossible to win and what does that mean that 10:59 means that automatically they are going to appoint very very very liberal judges 11:05 and all of this time that the republicans are fighting saying that we 11:09 don't want President Obama to appoint the judge jack tenner matter because the 11:15 new president who would be a Democrat will appoint the judge so it no longer 11:19 matters and you're probably talking about because it just seems to be the 11:24 appointment of three four or five Supreme Court judges and gotta start 11:31 thinking about that folks because anybody that does third party that's 11:36 what it's going to mean very simple it guarantees 100% guarantees the election 11:41 of the democrats that means the appointment of supreme court judges 11:47 34 or 5 that is a total wipe out 11:51 or conservatives and Republicans so start thinking about to start thinking 11:56 about it this was just an exciting time I'm having a lot of fun I have to tell 12:03 you that I was watching him and congratulations on the two states that 12:07 but he was saying the donald Trump has a ceiling of 35 to 40 percent well CNN 12:14 just came out with a pole two days ago that said I have 49 percent compared to 12:19 his 15 percent though I guess it's up forty I mean I have a 49% number some of 12:26 the polls are showing over 50% and I don't even think they're accurate have 12:33 won many polls as you know against hillary clinton directly and I'm the 12:38 only one that's gonna be der if she's allowed to run I'm the only one and only 12:48 one remember that and I am the one person that one person trust me that she 12:54 does not want to run against now we only had one little skirmish on that was four 12:59 weeks ago and that was not pleasant for her and bill but I'm the one person 13:06 and you know I'm I'm really ashamed of the press because they got it wrong they 13:10 didn't give me any credit when she went like this you remember when she was 13:13 beating burn easily and then four weeks ago all of a sudden he was doing great 13:18 you know why because she went down you know why because of my skirmish and I 13:22 got no credit please give me some credit for that so I look forward to that race 13:32 and again I haven't really done anything with hillary we haven't started and 13:37 Hillary except for the one moment for weeks ago but I think we're gonna have 13:41 something that's really bad you know I heard hillary today and I watched her 13:45 statement tonight and her statement is make america whole terrible say make 13:57 america whole I think she means were in a hole we're in a deep polls and we're 14:03 trying to dig our way out we r 19 trillion dollars and if that's the kind 14:10 of promotional ability we have on the other side are countries in big trouble 14:14 make america hole No 14:16 make America great again that's what mine is make America great very exciting 14:26 evening and again I just have to thank the people of Louisiana the people of 14:31 Kentucky you're amazing and I will never ever forget it I was in louisiana last 14:36 night and we had a group of people in a tariff plan hanger this massive hanger 14:41 and you couldn't even get them in this was a seriously big hanger for very very 14:46 big planes and I landed got out walked into the hanger there were thousands and 14:52 thousands of people and it was incredible and same thing a few days ago 14:58 in kentucky we had a rally that was incredible and today's rally in orlando 15:04 florida was nobody seen anything like it and they're writing about this 15:08 never seen anything like it in the history of politics in this country they 15:12 have never seen anything like it 15:14 that it was so reported even in the New York Times today on the front page 15:17 people have never ever seen anything like it in the history of politics in 15:21 the united states it's a movement so I just want to thank all of my friends all 15:26 of my members all of my everything you have been so supportive so great and 15:32 you're very very special people with that if you'd like to you know the press 15:40 as people ever created by God so I would love to take a few questions from these 15:47 dishonest people go ahead Press John John Scott everybody 16:01 ok if I can do it all do it john-john scarf everybody thank you john if I can 16:05 do it all yesterday ahead 16:25 I love you as a reporter where you where have you been this is the greatest guy 16:30 like I call in Lyon Teddy holds up the Bible in that he puts it down and 16:34 realize okay I never saw a man that light as much now lying dead know he 16:41 went he did the Ben Carson was a disgrace and actually made because had 16:44 he not gotten those been cars and boats I would have won iowa I wouldn't have 16:48 everything so tight Edwards frankly when he did voter violation on a form that 16:56 look like it came right out of a government agency 16:59 voter violation and the only way you get rid of the violation essentially is by 17:03 voting and going in voting for clues and people did that because they were afraid 17:09 it was it was terrible who's a very fraudulent thing and he's done a lot of 17:15 ben Carson to great guy he's a great great guy and I thought that was a 17:20 disgrace what he did to he said basically that Ben Carson's out of the 17:24 race 17:24 come on vote for me and he knew it was happening so one of those things but I 17:29 do think this I do think that that is at least moving along ok but Marco has to 17:36 get out of the race has to because despite what said Ted said do I want to 17:43 run against just hit that will be easy 17:46 ok david 18:07 and I think you know it and it's all done how many times do I have to say it 18:19 it's like it's like david is like as an example what is my position on nine 18:25 hundred different things I've said it a hundred and fifty times were not here 18:28 for just guessing that but everybody knows how I feel on it 18:32 question question david sit down shut down David David said that you know my 18:38 position yes go ahead yes John go ahead 18:49 what it should be because we're the only two that are winning by the way about 18:53 the one that beached on beating him almost three-to-one and on super tuesday 19:00 I got a million votes more than mark and a half a million votes more than ted 19:07 that's a lot of ok he's not going to win and he's not gonna win you know wat you 19:19 can't win and he's not gonna win something else first of all we should 19:23 I'd love to have a head-to-head matchup with him in Florida as an example and 19:26 Ohio but in new york he's not going to get very many votes in New Jersey and 19:32 Pennsylvania and Ohio is just not going to get very many votes so I would like 19:37 to see it I mean I would like Marco to drop out from the standpoint that I 19:40 think Mark gonna look at how we did tonight he's an he's in third and fourth 19:44 and somebody was nice enough to say that even when I don't want to state I always 19:48 come in second that's a big thing marc is coming for so I think it's time for 19:54 Marco to train the decade do and I say that respectfully 20:00 yeah because I wanted to go to a very lucky and that's a great guy but look I 20:06 wanted to go to Kansas I felt I had an obligation I did fairly well in Kansas 20:12 considering I spent you know literally an hour they're very small time but I 20:18 wanted to go to Kansas to campaign I been to CPAC from the beginning I've 20:23 liked it I respect the people at CPAC I respect matter a great deal I hated to 20:29 cancel but I really am doing something that's very important that people that 20:34 are cheap pack for the most part are campaigning I'm campaigning to be 20:37 president had I not gone to kansas's this morning I would not have done as 20:43 well as I did I came in second place so it was a very important thing John go 20:50 ahead right I take it more questions from reporters then any human being may 20:59 be that several live give me a break right now I don't get no no I was 21:06 hearing matt said today it was very interesting but I did like the format 21:11 and I would rather speak for 30 minutes but I hate when we're into you know you 21:16 speak for 10 or 15 minutes and then your interrupted and then you sit down you 21:20 take I've done that I've done it three times now I would rather speak but if 21:24 somebody wants to ask me in the case of that case of Sean Hannity or any of my 21:30 mean I would love to do that this was simply a fact that I wanted to campaign 21:35 and I'm campaigning very few people are campaigning and I'm very happy I did it 21:41 and I met a lot of great people in Kansas Mr Phil Ruffin who is one of the 21:45 most successful people in the United States really worked hard in kansas and 21:49 I felt I owed it to him and a lot of people to go there this morning 21:53 yes sir 21:55 yes 22:01 family yes 22:30 we would want to get to the bottom of it I think our weakness in dealing with 22:36 Iran has been unprecedented the fact that we gave them a hundred and fifty 22:41 billion dollars and they're a terrorist state the fact that they spent much of 22:45 that money buying other than american products as an example as you know they 22:49 bought a hundred and eighteen massive airplanes very larger planes from Airbus 22:53 not from Boeing not from anything having to do with this country they spent a lot 22:58 of their money all throughout Europe and they spent the day in russia by missiles 23:01 they gave us nothing I will I will get down to the bottom of that I think it's 23:06 a disgraced please give their fair his family my regards 23:09 I think it's a disgrace I think they know where he is one way or the other I 23:13 think they absolutely nowhere he is elected president I will get to the 23:17 bottom of it 23:29 25,000 people in a building today we had a send away so many thousands of people 23:37 we couldn't get them in when you have that many people if you have horrify 23:42 people or 10 people stand up out of 22,000 that are in this building that 23:47 speaking to a very great entertainers said Donald you the biggest draw in the 23:52 world without a guitar which is a sort of an interesting sort of an interesting 23:56 I won't tell you I won't tell you that was the great Elton John I will not tell 24:02 you that but somebody didn't make that seven when you have that many people you 24:06 understand in a room and you'll have a couple of nights curvaceous just a 24:10 couple of protest skirmishes and we treat them very gently in a ten years 24:16 ago they would have been treated differently about me but that's the way 24:19 life is we treat them very very gently and yeah we had a few protesters today 24:25 but very few I mean if you look at it as a percentage we had what one 24:29 one-hundredth of 1 percent of the people that were in the room so i watch Bernie 24:37 Sanders have a protest he was up at the microphone at two young ladies came up 24:40 and took the microphone away from him that will never happen with me he walked 24:45 meekly to the back of the room and I said isn't that pathetic -ism that said 25:03 somebody else and you know what happens to somebody else he's got 280 yards end 25:32 up my club champion stand-up do I hit the ball good do I edit law is trumped 25:38 strong so I just simply held up their hands he's a very strong hands and 25:45 they're fairly large actually but you know I was interesting because and you 25:50 should leave me bringing this up to be honest but it was very interesting 25:53 because the day after he said that I'm shaking hands with people and everybody 26:00 saying WOW you have strong hands you a very big heads again what happened is 26:04 market just may turn out better nowhere because he's a politician and 26:08 politicians lie and they say bad things and if you don't call them out for you 26:13 don't now I didn't bring it up he brought it up but I finished it and I'll 26:17 tell you about markets very interesting Marco attack to be viciously a week ago 26:22 two weeks ago so far every person that has gone down look at his numbers 26:30 tonight he cannot hold one of those Tony rallies where he did well because he did 26:35 really badly ok he's not going to stand up tonight and talk about how well he 26:40 did in Iowa where he was in third place and he acted like you won I agree with 26:44 you on that 26:47 I'd love it to be but they have to hear his story I would love it to be at a 26:52 high level I will be the most presidential candidate in history other 26:57 than honest Abe Lincoln he was very tough to be ok you look at a black and 27:01 he was serious right I will be a very pretty but when I get attacked by these 27:05 people at a low level I have to attack back I can't stand there some people say 27:09 you're above that you should stand beside me I can't do that and you know 27:13 I'll never do that for a country either yes go ahead 27:31 no good with Donald Trump I didn't know that I will believe it I totally did 27:41 knowing ya 27:53 I will help the party fund-raises I will help the party fundraiser I'm not 27:57 looking for funds for myself I'm totally self funding my campaign but I will 28:01 absolutely help the party fundraisers but I don't want any money from myself 28:05 ok yoga had no I'm not I think will win before the convention I think will win 28:13 before you know I sponsor a lot of sporting events and the fighters have a 28:17 great expression when they go into a city or a town where it's an unfriendly 28:21 town but they think they're gonna win they say the only way we guarantee 28:25 victory is to not come out the way I guarantee victory is to get enough 28:29 delegates so they don't have to worry about it and I think you know you think 28:33 about it like the price riders do that's called a knockout and you know where we 28:39 think we're gonna do very well in Florida where they going to do very well 28:42 and we got the two big ones don't forget Louisiana Kentucky tonight with the two 28:47 big ones main we did well in Maine really well in Maine but it was much 28:52 smaller than Louisiana Kentucky Kansas was also smaller and we came in second 28:57 in both but we want Louisiana and Kentucky if they were the big ones 29:03 go ahead 29:13 and what is a very very touchy subject it was originally as to debate to go to 29:22 bed crews and he said it didn't want any part of that question and I watched and 29:27 I said Wow and then they look to me that should how do you feel when I said I am 29:31 totally in favor of waterboarding and if we can I'd like to do much more than 29:35 that ok just so you understand we're playing by a different set of rules that 29:42 I says and others especially in the Middle East were playing by a different 29:45 set of rules so we have laws and rules and regulations and all of these things 29:50 and they have nothing they chopped off people's heads they drown people in 29:56 massive steel cages they drop the cage for one hour they lifted up and there 30:01 are 30 dead people and here we are worried about waterboarding so here's a 30:05 story I will obey the laws but I will try and get the laws extended I will try 30:14 and get the laws brought because we should be allowed because it's very hard 30:20 to be successful in beating someone when your roles are very soft and their rules 30:27 are unlimited they have unlimited they can do whatever they want to do and I 30:31 want to play military we're gonna knock out I should show violently and so fast 30:42 they chopped off they do things that we haven't seen since medieval times and 30:48 we're worried about waterboarding show here very wait wait wait to sit down 30:51 shut down let me just tell you kiss me so I want to stay within the laws and 30:56 right now we have to have the loss but i wanna make those laws stronger so that 31:03 we can better compete with a vicious group of animals ok ok yes 31:13 I think we have a twenty-point lead or something like that in florida go ahead 31:34 that Romney was a failed candidate it was a terrible candidate he choke me 31:39 choke absolutely joked as bad as I've ever seen other than Marco when chris 31:44 Christie was grilling him that was a big joke also I thought he was going to 31:48 collapse I was standing right next to marcia I was getting ready to hold them 31:52 up with these very powerful hands ok but Mitt Romney choice as a candidate and he 32:02 knows how I feel and when he was thinking of getting into the race 7 32:06 months ago eight months ago I said you can not let 32:10 important I said you cannot let Mitt Romney in this race he's a joker then 32:17 you know through sports some of my I can tell you I have some great sportsman 32:21 right here when you see somebody joke generally speaking once it Joker always 32:26 it now 32:28 Mitt Romney gave that election away that was an election against a failed 32:33 president that should have been easily won Mitt Romney didn't work hard that 32:38 last month he disappeared and say what you want about President Obama he was on 32:44 Jay Leno he was on David Letterman who was all over the place and where was 32:48 Mitt Romney we're all looking we're still looking for him 32:52 and if he would have devoted the same energy and time to winning the 32:56 presidency four years ago as years now and trying to destroy our party and the 33:01 unity of our party he would have won that election and we wouldn't have had 33:05 the problems that we have right now so ladies and gentlemen I want to thank you 33:10 this is amazing it's very exciting I look forward to seeing you in the near 33:17 future thank you very much thank you thank you thank you very much
