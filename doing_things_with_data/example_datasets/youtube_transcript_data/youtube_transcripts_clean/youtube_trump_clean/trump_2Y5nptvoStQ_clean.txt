0:00 so important so important 0:09 the people of Indiana have been 0:12 incredible i started as you know not 0:15 very long ago about six weeks ago and i 0:18 was told i had a 20-point deficit and i 0:22 went there and i worked very hard and I 0:24 campaigned and I made lots of speeches 0:26 and met lots of incredible people 0:28 incredible people you don't get better 0:31 and the crowds got bigger and bigger and 0:34 toward the end it was like I didn't want 0:36 to leave i almost said maybe I'll just 0:39 never leave and it it resonated somehow 0:42 and we had a tremendous victory tonight 0:45 it was a tremendous victory and i get i 0:49 have to think Bobby Knight what Bobby 0:51 night was incredible 0:59 I always say about you know people like 1:02 that there aren't many but it's called 1:04 tough smart and they know how to win and 1:08 that's what our country needs we have to 1:10 win again we have to know how to win and 1:12 we haven't won we've been losing all the 1:15 time we lose with our military we can't 1:17 beat Isis we lived with loose with trade 1:19 will is with borders windows with 1:22 everything we're not gonna lose we're 1:24 going to start winning again we're gonna 1:25 win bigley operation so when I got back 1:34 tonight and i started watching all of 1:38 the different networks i could see 1:40 immediately that we're doing very well 1:42 and it really looks like a massive 1:44 victory and looks like we went all 57 1:46 delegates is and I i must say in staying 1:58 in various places in Indiana we had I 2:03 turned on the television and all is 2:05 always negative ads negative one after 2:07 another after another and i called my 2:09 people and I said how can we win it just 2:12 constantly and it was the same as 2:14 Florida you know they've been 60,000 2:16 negative ads i got a ride from you folks 2:19 okay 60,000 effect two weeks goes 55,000 2:25 now it's 60,000 negative ads most of 2:30 which are absolutely false and 2:33 disgusting and I said how can anybody 2:37 under this I had one evening two nights 2:39 ago where literally they had five ads on 2:42 in between segments of a show that I was 2:45 watching and I said that's just 2:48 incredible and the people are so smart 2:50 they don't buy it they get it and 2:53 tremendous 2:56 tremendous amounts of money were spent 3:04 millions and millions of dollars and 3:07 they were comparing that they think it 3:08 was probably eight million dollars were 3:10 spent against me and we spent 900 3:14 thousand dollars so I mean to me that's 3:16 the way it's supposed to be 3:18 that's something that makes me feel 3:20 really really very good and now we're 3:25 going to Nebraska where I have I just 3:27 here we're doing really wonderfully i 3:29 look forward to that very much and West 3:31 Virginia and we're going to get those 3:33 miners back to work i'll tell you what 3:35 we're going to get those miners back to 3:38 work 3:38 we're not going to be Hillary Clinton 3:42 and I watched her three or four weeks 3:44 ago when she was talking about the 3:46 miners as if they were just numbers and 3:50 she was talking about she wants the 3:51 mines closed and she will never let them 3:53 work again let me tell you the miners in 3:57 West Virginia and Pennsylvania which was 3:59 so great to me last great Ohio and all 4:03 over there going to start to work again 4:06 believe me you're gonna be proud again 4:08 to be minor 4:13 so we'll be going there i must say this 4:19 tremendous run that we've had started 4:21 with New York when we had almost 4:23 62-percent and don't forget that's where 4:25 three people so 62-percent with two 4:28 people is a massive landslide but 4:30 sixty-three percent almost just a little 4:34 over 62 when you have that kind of a 4:35 number with three people it's actually 4:39 unheard of and all throughout it was 4:42 seventeen people that 15 and 12 you know 4:46 tremendous and we're getting very high 4:48 numbers and some of the numbers in my 4:50 opinion that i got in the early stages 4:52 word when a state with thirty-two 4:55 percent but there were 14 people i think 4:57 that might be actually more and better 5:00 than getting 62-percent in New York but 5:04 we never got credit for that but now we 5:05 don't need the credit because we're 5:07 going after Hillary Clinton she will not 5:17 she will not be a great president you 5:22 will not be a good president you will be 5:24 a poor president she doesn't understand 5:27 trade her husband sign perhaps in the 5:30 history of the world the single worst 5:33 trade deal ever done 5:36 it's called NAFTA and I was witness to 5:40 the carnage over the last six weeks 5:44 especially now I've known Syracuse and 5:46 I've known tipsy and I've known all of 5:49 the different places that i visited in 5:51 New York and then Pennsylvania and then 5:53 maryland which treated me so great and 5:55 the people are incredible and all of the 5:57 different states Connecticut and I've 6:00 witnessed what it's done really 6:02 firsthand and it has been indeed carnage 6:04 and we're gonna change it around 6:07 we're not gonna let carrier and all of 6:09 these companies just think that they can 6:11 move go to another country make their 6:13 products sell it back to us and we get 6:15 only one thing we got unemployment not 6:18 going to happen anymore folks not gonna 6:19 happen 6:25 we're going to bring back I jobs and 6:31 we're going to keep our jobs 6:32 we're not going to let companies leave 6:34 now if they want to go to a different 6:35 state 6:36 good luck compete but when they start 6:39 going to different countries and in many 6:41 cases countries that devalue their 6:43 currency and make it impossible for our 6:46 companies to compete 6:48 that's not going to happen not going to 6:49 happen and if they want to do it anyway 6:52 there will be consequences and there 6:54 will be very very serious consequences i 7:03 have to tell you that I've competed all 7:07 my life- person 7:09 all my life I've been in competitions 7:12 different competitions whether it's 7:14 sports or business or now for 10 months 7:18 politics and i have to tell you that I 7:21 have met some of the most incredible 7:25 competitors that i have ever competed 7:29 against right here on the Republican 7:32 Party you know we started off with that 7:33 17 number and just so you understand Ted 7:38 Cruz I don't know if he likes me or he 7:41 doesn't like me but he is one hell of a 7:44 competitor he is a tough mark 7:49 and he has got an amazing future 7:57 he's got an amazing future so i want to 8:00 congratulate Ted and I know how tough it 8:03 is it's tough it's tough 8:05 I've had some moments where it was not 8:07 looking so good and it's not a great 8:10 feeling and so I understand how Ted 8:13 fields and Heidi and their whole 8:16 beautiful family and I want to just say 8:18 though that one tough competitor and I 8:23 can say that for 8:25 I can say that for the others I mean 8:30 chris Christie who endorsed me 8:32 incredible guy 8:33 dr. ben Carson who was right up there 8:36 one of the first he just called me and 8:40 said it's a movement you've got going 8:42 we've got to do something because I'll 8:44 tell you what it's an incredible 8:45 movement and dr. ben Carson endorsed me 8:48 and I want to tell you that is an 8:49 incredible man and we want to keep them 8:51 totally involved because we win we're 8:54 gonna win in November 9:03 and we're going to win big and it's 9:06 going to be America first and i made a 9:08 speech the other day and I talked about 9:10 how where the policeman for the world 9:11 how we protect other countries and they 9:14 don't respect us and they don't take 9:16 care of us and they don't treat us right 9:18 in many cases and that's not going to 9:20 happen now we can keep things going and 9:22 we're going to keep things going very 9:24 nicely but we do 21 soon 21 trillion 9:27 dollars is 19 now but with a budget that 9:30 was recently done soon it will be 21 9:32 trillion dollars and we just not in the 9:35 position that were in 30 years ago 40 9:37 years ago 50 years ago with a lot of 9:38 these things took place and began taking 9:40 place so we can have unbelievably good 9:44 relationships with other countries but 9:47 likewise they have to treat us fairly 9:50 and they have to understand that what 9:52 we've been doing over the years has been 9:53 so wrong and so unfair to the United 9:57 States and to its people into its 9:59 taxpayers so that will change and i will 10:03 tell you they can end up liking us 10:05 better than they do right now they're 10:07 going to respect us in this building 10:10 right upstairs 10:16 and this building right upstairs i have 10:20 the largest bank in the world from China 10:22 the relationship is fantastic 10:24 we have great relationships with many 10:26 foreign countries but they have to 10:30 respect us and they have to understand 10:32 where we're coming from and you know it 10:34 is a two-way street and the two-way 10:36 street means that we're going down one 10:38 side and they're coming up the other and 10:41 we're going to meet and we are going to 10:43 have something that's going to be really 10:45 fabulous now if that can't happen if for 10:48 some reason they want the system to 10:50 continue the way it's going now which is 10:53 unfair and not good where we're spending 10:56 trillions and trillions of dollars 10:58 probably four trillion dollars in the 11:00 middle east and we have to rebuild our 11:02 infrastructure our roads we have to 11:05 rebuild our bridges our airports our 11:07 hospitals in this country we've become 11:10 close to a third world country you look 11:12 at some of our airports its third world 11:14 and then you go to other countries and 11:16 you see places like you've never seen 11:18 so i have to say that we are going to 11:21 turn it around 11:23 we're going to build up our military 11:24 bigger better stronger than ever before 11:27 it's the cheapest thing we can do and 11:29 we're gonna have to take out Isis and 11:31 we're gonna have to take them out fast 11:32 we can't allow that 11:35 cancel to continue you can not allow it 11:39 to continue 11:40 and you know one group that's been so 11:44 incredible to me or the vets the 11:46 veterans and their been treated so badly 11:49 so and we're gonna get that we're going 11:53 to get that straight now one of the 11:56 things that just happened which to me is 11:58 very exciting and it's happening now 11:59 with two or three but the rest of us and 12:02 Paul came out yesterday and in that Paul 12:05 I'm now leading hillary clinton lot of 12:07 good things 12:16 ok 12:18 and that's going to continue because 12:27 they're not going to be able to do it 12:29 folks they're not going to be able to 12:30 make great trade deals we have such bad 12:32 deals they're not going to be able to do 12:34 what we can do with the military they're 12:35 not going to be able to do what we're 12:36 going to do on the border including the 12:38 wall 12:39 we're gonna have unbelievably great 12:41 relationships with the Hispanics the 12:44 Hispanics have been so incredible to me 12:47 they want jobs 12:49 everybody wants jobs the African 12:51 Americans want jobs you look at what's 12:53 going on they want to 12:55 we're gonna bring back our jobs and 13:01 we're going to save our jobs and people 13:02 are going to have great jobs again and 13:04 this country which is very very divided 13:07 in so many different ways is going to 13:09 become one beautiful loving country and 13:14 we're gonna love each other we're going 13:15 to cherish each other we're gonna take 13:17 care of each other and we're going to 13:19 have great economic development and 13:21 we're not going to let other countries 13:22 take it away from us because that's 13:25 what's been happening for far too many 13:26 years and we're not going to do it 13:28 anymore 13:30 we're not going to do it anymore i want 13:35 to thank and congratulate the Republican 13:39 National Committee and runs previous so 13:42 i just spoke to he's doing a tremendous 13:45 job it's not an easy job when he had 17 13:48 egos and now I guess he's down to one I 13:51 don't know is there a second second you 13:59 have to ask you folks to explain the 14:01 status of that but but he's done an 14:03 amazing job and I think we're going to 14:06 see something really really fantastic i 14:08 also want to thank my staff paul khoury 14:13 hope I mean

media the 15:13 press they wouldn't believe people that 15:15 have said the worst things about me 15:18 I've never had things said about me like 15:20 this you know when my businesses I've 15:22 always been very respected people didn't 15:24 talk to me this way but in politics it's 15:26 easy 15:27 the worst things and they're calling now 15:30 and they're calling us all and they're 15:33
