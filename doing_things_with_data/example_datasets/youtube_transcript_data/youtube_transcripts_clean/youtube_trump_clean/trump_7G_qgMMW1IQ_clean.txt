21:55 next 22:50 we are going back a lot of stats on how doing and it's no different really than 23:29 the country to country is doing lousy we're losing our jobs they're moving to 23:33 other countries that moving to mexico they're moving all over the place they 23:37 fire there people they make their product they send it in here and no tax 23:41 no nothing give me a break ok it's not gonna happen so 23:47 there are few places in America that have been more devastated economically 23:54 by our trade policies that fits great we know that we know what's happened don't 24:00 worry we'll bring it all back don't worry about it ok according to the 24:08 Federal Bureau of getting them from the books according to the Federal Bureau of 24:14 Labor Statistics pittsburgh has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs 24:20 since 2001 one-third 24:26 this happened to be by the way the year that China and the world trade 24:31 organization 24:34 and started ripping us off ok from the Pittsburgh Business Times United States 24:43 Steel Corp said Wednesday it would be cutting about 25% of its nine unionized 24:49 workforce including jobs in Pittsburgh all over the country we're getting just 24:53 devastated also according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Pittsburgh also laws 24:59 20% of its construction jobs since 2007 25:07 and we love the place you know we love ik just so you understand I went to 25:12 school in the state right we know that right I know I know a lot about 25:19 pennsylvania and it's great how's Joe Paterno we can bring that back how about 25:27 about that whole whole deal and we do love pense a toi love Penn State I mean 25:35 at all 25:38 we love Penn State but we love pittsburgh ride the state of 25:45 pennsylvania's los Borre this one more than forty percent of its manufacturing 25:50 I mean when you think of it 25:53 35 percent since 2000 so it's rose 35 percent of its manufacturing since the 26:00 year 2000 Pennsylvania we know this provided steel to the entire world again 26:10 a wage-earner could support their entire family on an income in the mill and you 26:19 know that's a different thing now and now they're being laid off all over the 26:22 place and by the way I have to tell you something 26:24 steel will bring it back and I said it called clean call will bring it back 26:32 the politicians a little bit smarter than you think by the way summer dummies 26:41 but a little bit just understand I'm self funding my campaign when I come 26:46 here on paying for it 26:47 ok 26:50 but the politicians are all taken care of by the special interest they're all 26:56 you look at a guy like cruise he's in favor of DPP DPP 27:03 lion's den my client 27:15 so he wants the trans-pacific you know the trans-pacific partnership which is a 27:21 big ripoff that'll be another nafta deal that would be disastrous for our country 27:25 and he made it impossible for us to negotiate this single greatest weapon 27:32 against us which is currency devaluation he wouldn't let it happen and it's no 27:38 good to start off with but without currency devaluation in their big league 27:43 it's a disaster 27:44 it'll take so many jobs from this country from this area we're not gonna 27:49 let it happen you know the agreement is 5,000 pages long 27:58 many countries involved those countries have read every single little word 28:03 they've analyzed it fifteen different ways from China and you know what all 28:07 the china is not in the deal I have to be honest but they will be in the deal 28:11 if the deal turns out to be as good as everyone saying for those competing with 28:15 China will come in through the back door and they'll be there too don't worry 28:19 about it but when you think of it they 5,000 pages every word by those 28:26 countries and we I get most of the people doing it and even read the 28:31 documents trucks they don't even read that and in the end I refuse to use bad 28:38 language but in the end we will be taken advantage of you know why because the 28:43 United States is represented by incompetent people and/or dishonest 28:48 people and within a half that practice stopped working to use our toughest our 28:52 smartest and we're gonna stop it 28:58 so it's one of the great betrayal to it really is this is the town of the 29:05 Pittsburgh Steelers which we love we love to fish and you can have a good 29:11 season coming up we gotta keep been good and healthy and have a good season it's 29:16 still city and when I'm president Guess watch deal is coming back to Pittsburgh 29:22 and a lot of other things are coming back so that's the way it is you know we 29:29 were I just did Sean Hannity we did a big beautiful showroom little bit 29:34 different location in Pittsburgh so it's on tonight if anybody wants to watch by 29:38 the time we finish you will have enough you'll go home so broad and had enough 29:42 don't watch on tonight but it's a pretty good show we just did it we had a packed 29:47 theater was an incredible place and we had it packed and there's love in that 29:51 room this tremendous love in what we're doing this is i love you too I love you 30:02 what we have going folks we have a movement going you know I've been in 30:06 upstate New York now for the last 45 days and when you see what's happened to 30:11 upstate New York in particular and different places in New York it could 30:16 make you absolutely cry it really could jobs being taken 60% 70% of the jobs in 30:23 manufacturing forget about it 30:26 the people are incredible I Q the people are incredible people they stick with it 30:30 they want to make it great and they want to make America great again but they 30:34 want to bring it back they want to bring it back and I'll tell you what we're 30:38 going to you know when you see these companies you so recently carrier Air 30:42 Conditioner where they fired 1,400 people like it was nothing and then 30:46 moving to mexico and then they gonna make the rare conditions they gonna make 30:50 their air conditioners they're gonna send him over he says build the wall 30:54 you're right we're gonna build the wall 31:19 are you ready and who's gonna pay for the wall 100% ok 100 you know mexico and 31:32 I have great relationships with mexico the mexican people Hispanics thousands 31:36 of a word from either fantastic in Nevada which I won I won the state of 31:40 Nevada they did a poll they did a poll and the poll came out where the 31:45 hispanics who's most popular donald Trump people that live here legally they 31:50 love donald Trump because they don't want their jobs taken away they don't 31:54 want crime data what the problems that are being caused in our country we have 31:57 huge problems so we are in fact we're going to have a strong voter just so you 32:03 understand 15,500 Border Patrol people last week endorsed me they've never 32:10 endorsed a presidential candidate for ever and you know they're great people 32:16 they want to do their jobs and they're told to stand back when like Swiss 32:20 cheese stand back let everybody just walk in 32:23 not going to be any more we either have a country or we don't have we are not 32:26 borders we don't have a country and people come into our country but they're 32:30 coming in legally legally legally 32:34 Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Arizona who does endorse donald Trump ride we have so 32:42 many great endorsements so many great you know if you just look i mean Sarah 32:49 Palin into a jeff Sessions senator jeff says she has so many Michael Sata 32:56 Michael Savage indoors but so many unbelievable jerry falwell junior speed 33:03 so incredible Liberty University jerry falwell junior has been so incredible 33:08 and when I went with the evangelical so often I go to South Carolina they said 33:13 well that's a cruise stronghold on the Gaza strongholds like a dead lion 33:21 now the the evangelicals do not like liars 33:26 you know I say he walks in with the Bible held high he walks in his client 33:33 at Bible held I puts it down and then he starts to like remember what he did with 33:38 ben Carson who endorse me a great guy great guy and he goes the Iowa during 33:46 the election election and he said ben Carson is out of the race this is people 33:52 have voted so vote for Alliant tech and they all believed him and then right 33:58 after the election was over he could do apologize ok this is this is what we 34:04 have representatives and you don't worsen that were so how about this he's 34:08 always saying I'm the only one that can be done from have proven it i won utah 34:14 now the week of Utah was the week of Arizona which I wanted to massive 34:20 landslide many more but he doesn't say that I want hours only got many more 34:26 delegates 34:27 gathering right here in lower my huge rally perhaps his biggest yet we are 34:40 less than believable situation somebody said what have you learned about 34:44 politics and politicians now you know all my life I've dealt with politicians 34:48 and many of them are very dishonest people I've known that for years but I 34:52 had no hillary you talk about him 34:59 she's the most dishonest of all thats the one that's you know they're saying 35:07 that maybe she can't be present for a number of reasons you'll probably scared 35:12 by what do you think they're protecting her there protecting owner did you see 35:18 web Bernie Sanders said Bernie said this did you see we're burning Sanders said 35:26 she's not qualified to be President right and any sort of loci that a little 35:32 bit getting heat and he said why did he said you know what he said 35:37 bad judgement get their judgment she does have first of all she voted for the 35:41 war in Iraq she wanted to go to Libya you know he's got Libya right now her 35:45 baby you know he's got Libya right now and the oil I says I says 35:53 I dunno what our country does about it do we do blockades do we blow the hell 35:57 out of it do we do they have some of the finest oil in the world 36:03 niacin hi highest-quality isis has it what do we do they do whatever they want 36:10 said keep the oil oil don't go into Iraq I was always against it 36:15 they went in destabilize the middle east then Obama gives a certain date when we 36:20 gonna go out takes everybody out that's when you should have kept some there but 36:24 I always said keep the oil keep the oil we didn't do it we did it so now I say 36:31 knocked the hell out of the oil we don't do that because it may have an 36:35 environmental impact can you imagine General George Patton one of the 36:41 toughest guys General George Patton General Douglas MacArthur where they say 36:46 we don't want to bomb the oil because it may have an impact on the environment 36:51 what we doing what are we doing so we now have Libyan play Benghazi all of 36:59 that that was hillary's baby and now what we have now want to remember the 37:04 famous phone call 37:05 who would you want answering your phone at three in the morning she wasn't there 37:09 to answer you're right I'll be there I'll be there I'll be there 37:17 she's got big bad judgment I'll tell you I did hillary clinton becomes and will 37:28 beat her and beat her easily if hillary clinton becomes president and Ted Cruz 37:33 get better first of all I have a chance of winning new york you in New York you 37:38 have a whole different Matt nobody else can do that and the numbers are 37:41 incredible if you look at new york 37:44 243 . lead 43 points and everybody knows my relationship to Pennsylvania and I've 37:55 been here I used to play Cobbs Creek does anyone know where Cobbs Creek is 37:59 God's grace I used to play it believed me but Cobbs Creek but every one really 38:04 knows my relationship to pennsylvania has a special relationship and we're 38:08 gonna keep going but here's what we have to be careful in Colorado right now 38:12 there picketing and going wild because the bosses and the establishment and the 38:19 people that shouldn't have this power took all of the power away from the 38:23 voters so the voters never got to vote and the voters didn't know that except 38:28 when I got up and complained because they did it after I joined the race and 38:32 they figured I'd probably went Colorado which I would I would win colorado like 38:37 my polls here to explain that so in Colorado they're all delegates and we 38:42 had delegates ago ended don't take them and then they take these others so they 38:46 get to delegates without voting two people don't read his what's happening 38:50 here so we vote and whoever wins gets 17 delegates but whoever doesn't win can 38:57 get like 35 or whatever the differences between the sake of it you beat somebody 39:03 badly with the people because it's a rigged system folks the republicans is a 39:09 rigged system and so is the democrat system by the way because you know what 39:13 do you like Bernie Sanders and I happen to think is terrible but that's ok but 39:17 whether you like it or not know whether you like him or not you turn on 39:21 television every week 39:22 birdies 39:24 Bernie Sanders when next week Bernie Sanders when he wins every weekend and 39:29 then you listen to the pundits but it went amazing one every week for the last 39:34 seven weeks right but he can't win and he said what's going on it's a rigged 39:39 system you know they have things go super delegates and we have a different 39:42 system which is equally rich and what it does is it allows the bosses to pick 39:47 whoever they want and whoever they want is a guy like Romney use a stiff who 39:52 frankly lose the election last 39:57 he blew the election because that was an election that should have been one look 40:02 I backed John McCain and that was tough because he inherited a problem but I 40:08 back John McCain a loss I back to run the any loss that one should have been 40:12 one and this time I said you know what we gotta do it ourselves and our self 40:17 but but you can let the boss is taken away so I would let's take his work by 40:27 like 20 points in the polls just came out and won by a lot and you see these 40:31 crowds same thing was packed he said have never seen anything like it 40:37 this great spirit this great movement is this is a movement like they haven't 40:41 seen people that never seen anything like this 40:45 they've never seen anything like it actually a pundit who hates me I want 40:51 uses day but they said whether you like it or not it's one of the great 40:56 phenomena is that we've ever seen in the history of this country has said was he 40:59 talking about me I can't believe it but what we've got forget about me what 41:04 we've got is one of the great phenomenon I go to dallas texas we fill up the 41:08 Mavericks stadium I go to Mobile Alabama 35,000 people we have twenty twenty-five 41:14 thousand people the other night we had twenty thousand people in Albany New 41:18 York than two people want results 41:21 tired of it the tired the politicians and you know a lot of times I'll give a 41:26 speech I'll say how to fix the solution because nobody's going to be better 41:29 bringing jobs back to me nobody nobody's art nobody's 41:33 and I'm not going to be affected by people that gave me money because I've 41:40 turned down tens of millions of dollars I feel like so stupid for doing that my 41:45 whole life I take money money that's why business right I take I keep taking 41:49 taking taken I built this incredible company I started off I mean think of it 41:55 I started with a million dollar loan I built a company that's worth more than 41:59 ten billion dollars more over a relatively short period of time 42:07 some of the greatest assets in the world very little debt tremendous cash flow 42:11 and I say that not depressed I say that because that's the kind of thinking at 42:17 least for a little while that's the kind of thing we need in our country of 19 42:22 trillion dollars with sitting on a bubble we've got it straighten out our 42:26 country we've got a rebuild our military our military is being decimated its 42:31 being decimated we gotta knock the hell out of Isis we gotta not come out 42:41 we've got it take care of our great veterans on Veterans and not being taken 42:44 properly care of it we're gonna take out we've got a repeal and replace Obamacare 42:51 which we've gotta do we will Obamacare is a disaster 42:58 you look at your premiums are going up 25 35 45 percent nobody understand you 43:04 know can't use the deductible is so high you can use it unless you trust to death 43:09 or probably dead it's impossible 43:12 the deductable Obamacare is a catastrophe by the way in seventeen its 43:19 gonna implode anyway 43:20 ok it's dead unless the republicans revived it again you know they did a 43:24 budget two months ago the Omnibus Budget it paid for the syrians coming in it 43:30 pays for illegal immigrants coming in it pays for Obamacare folks those days are 43:39 over 43:45 so I only say to you you gotta go out of this so incredible you gonna be so happy 43:52 you gotta go out and vote and when you vote remember this evening but you gotta 43:57 go out and vote and for those of you that are trying to be delegates and a 44:01 lot of times they rejected and I'm not blaming Pennsylvania I'm not blaming 44:05 anything I'm just saying the system is a corrupt system it's a rigged system we 44:10 gotta change it you know what if I just accomplished that where you can get the 44:15 people that you vote I have millions of more votes than crews you know if you 44:19 add up the different primaries millions and millions more than kasich he's only 44:24 got one state I me John who voted for nafta by the way anybody votes for nafta 44:29 it's a problem but John we have 32 states right now that we went through 44:36 the process so jon's 14 32 and that's his state and had i campaigned there for 44:41 two more days you know what happened I was winning florida is Florida and Ohio 44:45 and I had a way that was a big one and I campaign and what happened is they came 44:52 out with a poll that I thought was a dirty pool you know to dirty politics a 44:55 phony poll it was done by NBC Wall Street Journal and I was leading by 14 45:01 points 15 points 18 points I'm doing great and then all of a sudden right 45:06 before a couple days before they came out with this phony Paul Wall Street 45:10 Journal remember NBC and I said to myself wow I was only up like six points 45:15 and added Trump is imploding dropped almost 20 points so instead of going to 45:26 Ohio for two more days which I was all set to do I say that Florida the poll 45:32 turned out to be wrong and i won by 20 points I won by a landslide 45:39 and if I would have gone to Ohio for two more days I would have won I would have 45:45 wanted but you know I had to stay and we we did great in Florida we did great in 45:50 Ohio too but I wasn't able to go because I believe this phony phony dirty coal 45:56 and that's the way it is that's the way politics is somebody said what's the 46:00 difference between the tough businessman as I deal with the toughest people in 46:03 the world in terms of business and when to use some of those people the smartest 46:06 in the best to negotiate a trade deals fall to negotiate they said what's the 46:13 difference between them and politicians I said what one is that and I'm not 46:18 talking about every politician just most of the politicians are much more 46:21 dishonest ok and that doesn't mean the business guys around the business people 46:26 are much tougher than much much tougher but the politicians are much more 46:31 designers much bored to see many more lies and it's a big difference i mean to 46:35 be honest but the business people are much tougher the tough to top you take 46:39 the top and then much much tougher but we're going to use those good ones I 46:43 know the best in the world and right now we have political hacks negotiating the 46:48 biggest deals in the world which is trade deals is bigger than any deal you 46:52 can make with companies is a country's make it deals with us and just ripping 46:56 us they're ripping us apart and that's why when I come to Pittsburgh when I go 46:59 to upstate New York no matter where I go I look at these and you know I work from 47:05 every place I go I say do me a favor give me a little chart of how the 47:10 community is doing whether it's Pittsburgh or Albany New York or New 47:15 York or anyplace I was at Rochester the other day with 15,000 people we believe 47:22 I say give me a chart and have a guy that does and it gives me like a page or 47:29 two pages like some of the stuff I read you I didn't even read you the bad stuff 47:32 i dont wanna make you depressed ok but I say give me a chart and do it quickly I 47:38 want to know every time I go so far I've made so many speeches every charges 47:44 negative there's no choice it's positive it's like every choice they're losing 47:48 their jobs in manufacturing was out in your case to steel business has been 47:51 decimated 47:52 added that the coal business has been totally decimated 47:55 gonna bring it all back ok we're gonna bring I'm so good at this time so good 47:59 gonna bring it all back yet to be so happy you're gonna be so happy so just a 48:05 couple of things just a couple of things because then you go back home and you 48:09 like Sean Hannity ok i'm ok I'm saying that is the CNN camera rolls ok folks 48:19 folks these are the most people these people are far worse they're far worse 48:28 than the politicians 48:33 they are far worse than the politicians ok it's called the media the media they 48:41 are the worse you know I have to tell you I started getting kicked out but so 48:48 we've won a lot of states and it wasn't supposed to win like we won the entire 48:54 South you know little thing like we won everything and crews lion's head was 49:01 supposed to win so we had a little mishap because of the dishonesty of this 49:07 system in Colorado and the New York Times writes an article today like 49:12 negative and I said to states that I want they don't do that they don't talk 49:18 about that they don't they never talked about positive if people call me like we 49:23 want to talk about a certain deal fourteen years ago this building where I 49:27 said what about the thousand what about all these years it worked out so great 49:30 you know I built a fortune but we're not interested in them we want to talk about 49:35 something and I said what about ninety seven times and actually a lot of times 49:40 by the time you really reject it turns out to be successful in a really good 49:44 businessmen when the economy crashes and you're in the middle of a big job maybe 49:47 it's a building or a dealer factory or something right 49:51 the really good ones are the ones that can take a catastrophe and make it good 49:55 I've taken some deals it should be terrible and made a better than if the 49:59 economy stays strong and the reason you lose it is sometimes the economy is 50:03 going to be blamed for the economy 50:05 the politicians maybe but the really good ones are the ones that can take a 50:09 bad condition and you go in and you beat up the banks and you go and you know 50:13 that people don't like the banks but frankly there you go when you have to 50:16 make deals with banks you two sorts of things but the beauty and the really 50:20 best ones are you can take eight what what should be a bad deal and make it a 50:24 phenomenal deal and then sometimes make it better than if the economy had 50:29 remained strong it's really a true but I say sometimes we want to talk about a 50:34 certain deal I said man when was it was it was 18 years ago I said what about 50:39 the good deals you know when these are the most dishonest 50:44 human beings I'm telling you they are the worst so that's the star that system 50:47 that system do we agree on that terrible human beings as we can't let them and I 51:03 think I'll probably do well with the delegates who knows you know the bosses 51:06 don't like Trump they're gonna put their own delegates etcetera but you can't let 51:10 them win you cannot it's alright let him is very weak he's got a very weak voice 51:16 very weak voice very well 51:25 you know it's it's finally let me see who is that person let me see raise your 51:31 hand who are you are you are you at the agitator let me see who is it are you 51:38 the one your voice is very weak now is so weak that he's leaving now who is he 51:47 by 51:52 he's going home to mommy 51:57 I actually wanted to talk to him I actually won because you know when you 52:03 think of first of all my rallies you know they give us a bad press 52:07 first of all they never tell about how many places to pack it up a few days ago 52:12 they never talked about the size when I have 25,000 35,000 donald Trump a day 52:19 gave a speech today I say to my wife I come home I say did you see the size of 52:27 that crap because they always get good ratings so it's always fun but they 52:31 always show just my face in fact that's the one thing I liked about the 52:35 protesters the only thing that gets those cameras to move into the audience 52:40 to show how big the crowds are protesting because they view it as a 52:43 negative so they moved the you know for years I'm telling you for the last year 52:48 I didn't think the cameras good move like this except when there's a 52:53 protester in the back corner of the room the camera it looks like a pretzel it 52:57 does some crazy so I love by protesters because it's the only way people in fact 53:03 somebody said the other night man that crowd at all but he was big I should do 53:08 they actually showed a protester the audience and they plan to the Pats lol a 53:12 show otherwise it never show it we have the biggest crowds we have the most 53:17 loyal people you know a woman was on television three nights ago and the 53:22 announcer coming on with a negative said let me ask you because honestly I think 53:28 I'm gonna do fantastically with women we're gonna bring security to the 53:31 contrary we're gonna bring me look at look at the crowd look at that many 53:37 women please raise your hand 53:42 they went this is like three days ago and they had this really negative 53:50 wiseguy announcer and they went out to these fantastic women she was a woman a 53:56 probably fifty years old a fantastic person she had 10 people behind her 54:00 friends of hers and she had to try and jump buttons and they said well why does 54:06 it take to get you off Trump so that you wouldn't see what could he do she said 54:11 stop talking right now there is absolutely nothing he can do to get me 54:17 not to vote for him and I said sure 54:24 now that severe I agree that's okay and then the women are 10 friends behind her 54:29 said that's right that's right and you know what I wanted to do I wanted to get 54:33 up and I want to grab that television set and just kiss it I just I love I 54:38 love I love our people are people you know they say first of all I think we 54:43 have the smartest people I think we have added some of these demographics we we 54:50 are just winning by every age group 54:53 factor in New York and leading with women I'm leading with higher education 54:57 I'm leading with low education I went to get every category 55:01 well winning with the military will winning with the vets always we always 55:05 went with the police are police do an incredible job 55:10 ok our police do an incredible job so Fox so when I started this it was about 55:18 borders as I know about borders and it was about jobs it was about the economy 55:23 was about all of that was about trade because our trade is being taken China 55:28 we have a trade deficit with China of five hundred billion dollars a year then 55:35 they say you know these people that think they're conservative conservative 55:38 ok but I'm conservative and a lot of issues more conservative and free-trade 55:43 just like I like free trade but you need smart people to have free trade we need 55:47 smart leaders negotiated we don't have that we have very dumb people do it so I 55:52 like free trade I like free trade but his a problem so we have five hundred 55:57 billion dollar trade deficit now I consider that semi lost ok you know a 56:02 lot of its laws they like to say that doesn't mean we'll lose you believe me 56:05 it means losing somebody said well you have to pay more for the product if we 56:09 make it here cuz when to stop making apple computers and Apple products and 56:12 other products in this country not in China so 56:18 so some genius said well donald Trump doesn't know the product will take the 56:29 second category because we're gonna have jobs again in our country 56:32 jobs are all leaving so that's the deal but he has a story so we list five 56:37 hundred billion opinion not so much and then they'll say this is terrible 56:44 he'll start a trade war well when we lose that kind of money make you a 56:47 better off just don't do business and his what's going to happen in the real 56:52 well as soon as they realize a guy like me is in there that Syria's a guy like 56:57 me is in there that can't be bought off by the special interest was saying oh ok 57:01 we'll let China continued to rip us off because some of these guys on companies 57:06 that do business in China the back a lot of money off our economy the 57:10 I'm working for you folks that's what I'm doing 57:16 that's a hundred percent what I'm doing this for you know this country's been 57:21 great to me this country I don't need this this is not something I need it 57:25 my family always systeme dad why you do it I do it because this country has been 57:31 so great to me so great to my family and I'm gonna give back and we're gonna give 57:36 back the ultimate way we're gonna give it back we're gonna make our country so 57:42 strong so great and it's got so much potential you know when I go around and 57:47 I see crowds like this and I see people like this we have phenomenal people we 57:51 can do better than anybody we make better products in China 57:55 the problem is china chiefs they devalue the currency then not supposed to do it 58:00 and they do it because we have so many other problems and get away with it 58:03 there was a period about a year ago where they had just maxed out on on 58:07 currency they had just maxed out on devaluation then Obama gets into this 58:12 big thing with russia and this and that so many problems 58:16 China does they give themselves the biggest devaluation in two decades 58:21 okay twenty years they give themselves the biggest devaluation in many many 58:25 years you know we run by stupid people nobody's watching not gonna happen 58:31 anymore folks and then the heads of China come over and we give them state 58:36 dinners magnificent state dinners and they're ripping us light now I do a lot 58:41 of business which I have the largest bank in the world and one of my 58:44 buildings in manhattan they pay me rent a lot and it's a massive bag biggest in 58:49 the world it's from China I sell condos for tens of millions of dollars of 58:53 people from China I have to Bank of America building in San Francisco with a 58:57 great partner it's from 10 that's how I got it from China had made a lot of 59:00 money with china china's great I have no problem with china china's wonderful I'm 59:05 not angry at the chinese leaders I'm angry at our leaders for being so damn 59:10 stupid 59:19 so when we have a trade deficit with China more than five hundred billion 59:23 dollars and we have a trade deficit with japan that's through the roof you gotta 59:28 see these cars that come pouring off the largest ships you've ever seen you go to 59:31 Los Angeles the dots and I looked at cars it looks like Nascar which by the 59:36 way of that guy Brian France a great guy 59:39 endorsed me and is a phenomenal phenomenal but when I see those guys it 59:46 reminded me of NASCAR they come pouring off those boats and look like they're 59:50 going fifty miles an hour into our system and you know what you talk about 59:54 trade imbalance they send us millions of cars we send them practically nothing 59:59 and then we defend them and it's a wonderful but we gotta get paid 60:05 something we've got to do something folks we're getting ripped by everybody 60:11 we're getting ripped in nato and I don't want to break up nato you know I said 60:14 the countries that were giving a free ride to 28 countries they gotta pay up 60:19 most of them have a lot of money they gotta pay up you know why they don't pay 60:23 up because nobody else so we pay for the biggest percentage of nato to protect 60:28 them we pay so I said listen and I said it to the new york times and I said it 60:33 to the washington post and then they totally differently than what I say 60:40 nato's obsolete because it doesn't cover terrorism it was 68 years old it's time 60:44 you know the funny thing about it some experts at do nothing but study nato and 60:50 I don't you know I don't know much about nato but I have a lot of common sense 60:53 some of these experts that have been studying at all their lives they said we 61:01 never thought of that you know why this do something we showed the trees right 61:06 they said Wow 61:09 and then they said wait a minute they always tremendous amounts of money while 61:17 they do and I don't want to pay currently I want them to pay all of the 61:21 money that they always too many years in arrears they always a lot of money we've 61:24 been protecting them without them they would be a part of russia they would be 61:29 a part of something 61:30 lots of bad things would happen 61:32 I don't like keeping it together but people have to pay up people have to pay 61:36 up we defend saudi arabia one of the richest countries in the world so much 61:40 money before they all went down now they're making a fortune down they were 61:45 making a billion dollars a day we defend them they wouldn't be there for a very 61:49 long if we weren't around right every time there's a little problem with such 61:53 a beautiful planes are beautiful ships cost us a fortune 1000 pass all that 61:58 such an easy negotiation they have so much money why aren't they paying us and 62:02 I'm not talking about protection money i'm saying they gotta pay a fair price 62:06 because we can't continue to be the policeman of the world 62:11 defend all of these countries and continue to lose weekend 62:19 so the new york times because you always have to be prepared to walk it's 62:33 possible it which case we'll say sorry we can't do it we can do it and if they 62:39 aren't they are and frankly you have the maniac in north korea we take care of 62:43 South Korea to have 28,000 soldiers on the line but you have the guy in north 62:47 korea 62:48 and he's probably gonna be pretty smart guy takes over a country like that in a 62:53 dummy right but he takes over the canal donald Trump probably a smart guy who 63:00 goes into takes over a country at his young age with all these generals 63:05 killers are me too gotta give him credit watch the press was donald Trump 63:10 you know Putin said Donald Trump is a genius to the press said what you said 63:26 Donald Trump is a junior said he's gonna be a great leader something the press 63:31 and the guys I'm running against wanted me to just about the statement i said im 63:36 gonna do when somebody calls me besides I honestly wouldn't it be great if we 63:43 actually got along with russia wouldn't it be great if we could get russia and 63:50 they've already been doing some of it but maybe not as much as we'd like 63:54 wouldn't it be great if we could get Russia to be dropping bombs all over I 63:57 said I would not expect very expensive and then you have guys like Lindsey 64:04 Graham where he gets up we should be doing that Russia should not be involved 64:08 I don't mind if you know how expensive it is where they spend a half a million 64:13 dollars a bomb in fact they left now they said we've had you know why it was 64:18 probably so expensive they said we got to get the hell outta here they just 64:21 left but here's a story folks we're gonna get smart again we're gonna get 64:26 smart with it to get smart with the military with a makeup military so 64:31 strong so powerful that nobody's gonna mess 64:35 we're gonna go from making the worst trade deals in history in the history of 64:42 any country to having great trade deals where we bring jobs back when we bring 64:47 money back we bring factories back when we bring your steel industry back china 64:52 is dumping steel all over the United States ok it's killing you now maybe we 65:00 get a little lower price but we lose all the jobs remember that they'd ever talk 65:04 about the second book to create jobs so people can pay to create good jobs to 65:09 real jobs were gonna build United States still back when you get these coal 65:13 companies back that dying they're dying I mean I'm going to West Virginia very 65:21 soon and I let it rest are you from West Virginia I love what a great place I was 65:32 there twice a day off I have a great friend in West Virginia and i think is 65:37 gonna run for governor actually a job but I have a great present West Virginia 65:41 but what they've done to the coal mines what they've done to the energy world 65:46 the energy that we have what they've done to stop us from taking our energy 65:51 out of the ground is is incredible so I look forward to being in West Virginia 65:56 by the way I do we don't want anymore we don't want with trade with a win with a 66:10 military we can't be nice we don't win with anything on health care stinks 66:15 folks we're going
