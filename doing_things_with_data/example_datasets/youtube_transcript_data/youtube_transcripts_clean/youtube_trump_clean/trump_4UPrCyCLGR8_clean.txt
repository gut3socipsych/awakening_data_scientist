the people were taking it back 1:41 it's been a long time as I travel the country the crowds get bigger and the 1:47 enthusiasm grows thousands of people outside they just left because I figure 1:51 we can't get in unless somebody wants would anybody like to give up their city 1:55 now I thought you were going to say that but there's so much love in the rooms 2:02 the Washington insiders they're panicking they are very concerned they 2:06 look at what's going on with the polls and they're saying what's happening 2:11 this wasn't supposed to happen it wasn't supposed to happen in the primaries and 2:16 this wasn't supposed to happen but it's happening and I think we're gonna bring 2:20 it all the way we are going to replace our failed and corrupt establishment 2:29 with a new government that serves you your family the country you're going to 2:34 be happy the change is going to begin right away the key is november eight if 2:40 you can get in there a little early that's okay too 2:42 november eight my economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words 2:49 jobs jobs jobs we have to bring our jobs back on my first day in office i'm going 2:59 to order a review of every single regulation and executive order issued by 3:04 president obama 3:08 all job-killing regulations and all illegal executive orders will be 3:13 immediately terminated excessive regulation cost our economy two trillion 3:22 dollars here you believe that two trillion dollars here I want to put that 3:26 money back into the pockets of the American people where it belongs 3:32 i am going to direct the Department of Commerce to identify every single 3:37 violation of our trading rules by our foreign competitors who in many cases 3:43 sheet we will apply every lawful remedy to end these trade abuses once and for 3:51 all we have no choice we're going to end then trade will be fair and reciprocal 4:00 and products will be made in America and sold all around the world like we used 4:05 to do it you know when we were smart 4:08 we're going to pass one of the biggest and boldest tax reforms and tax 4:14 reductions in American history it's going to include a 15-percent tax rate 4:20 for all businesses small and large making our country a magnet for new jobs 4:26 that's fifteen percent down from thirty-five percent 4:32 income taxes will be cut dramatically for the workers of workers that I mean 4:37 the really hard workers 4:39 you're paying too much tax folks everybody knows it 4:44 so for the workers the middle class families everybody we're having a major 4:48 major tax reductions and i will tell you 4:52 Ivanka Trump wants childcare taken care of and we're going to do that okay 4:59 also in my first day i'm going to ask Congress to immediately send me a bill 5:04 to repeal and replace Obamacare 5:16 three mins in ohio have increased more than eighty percent since Obamacare was 5:22 passed eighty percent have you noticed it's not a pretty picture right 5:28 eighty percent premiums have gone up almost $5,000 nationwide since 2009 more 5:37 than two-thirds of our nation's counties and think of this have lost ensures 5:42 everyday i'm reading another one left all the big ones are all leaving its 5:46 falling anyway we're going to replace it and then terminated but even if we 5:50 didn't it's not making it just so you understand we're going to replace 5:55 government-run Obamacare with reforms that put patients first these reforms 6:04 include expanding access to popular healthcare savings accounts empowering 6:09 Americans to shop for their insurance so that they can really have great choice 6:14 right across state lines and to block granting and really important Medicaid 6:20 to the States so they can design innovative solutions to the best and 6:25 it's going to be solutions folks that best serve you your families your 6:31 children the whole thing best serve you 6:38 in addition to prosperity we will also provide safety we are going to take a 6:44 swift strong action to protect the American people from radical Islamic 6:51 terrorism 6:57 in recent days terrorists have attacked in new york city new jersey and 7:04 Minnesota and it's going to get worse it's going to get worse if Hillary as 7:10 president it would be a disaster if Trump is president you'll be very very 7:15 happy now 7:19 yeah 7:21 yeah 7:27 not a pretty picture but if Trump is President you watch how good it will be 7:33 it will be a whole different all these attacks like so many others were made 7:40 possible because of our extremely open immigration system it's time to put firm 7:47 immigration controls in place 7:51 extreme wedding right extreme vetted to quote the bipartisan Commission 911 8:00 it is perhaps obvious to state that terrorists cannot plan and carry out 8:04 attacks in the united states if they are unable to enter our country 8:09 how about that that is why are my first day in office i will immediately suspend 8:15 the admission of Syrian refugees President Obama wants to bring in 8:24 another 110 thousand refugees next year 8:28 Hillary Clinton wants a five hundred and fifty percent increase over Obama's 8:34 numbers of Syrian refugees and we know nothing about the people 8:42 altogether the hillary clinton plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her 8:48 first term her plan would cost 400 billion dollars in terms of lifetime 8:57 welfare and entitlement cause think of that not only the danger of it all 9:03 this isn't only a matter of terrorism but also a matter of quality of life we 9:09 want to make sure that we're only admitting those into our country who 9:12 support our values and love and I mean love our people 9:20 you polling shows that in many of our countries 9:30 yeah 9:31 yeah 9:35 by the way governor pence just come here for a second Lee I see him standing 9:43 backstage 9:45 this was one of my really great decisions right here this guy is a 9:50 winner 9:58 great guy and a great family pew polling shows that in many of the countries from 10:06 which we drew a large numbers of immigrants extreme views about religion 10:11 are commonplace for instance according to Pew a majority in afghanistan and 10:17 pakistan SE honor killings of women are often or sometimes justified a majority 10:25 of these countries also support the death penalty for those who leave the 10:29 faith we've admitted tens of thousands from these countries in the last few 10:35 years with no effective screening plan in place we have no we have no idea who 10:40 are letting in we have no idea what's happening in fact Hillary Clinton as 10:44 Secretary of State admitted multiple refugees who were later charged with 10:49 terrorism related activities bad ones 10:52 the State Department administers the refugee program Hillary had the chance 10:58 to put the needed protections in place and she didn't do it and now she's 11:03 running she's going to be so tough 11:05 she's gonna be so tough not going to be tough not gonna be tough 11:12 Hillary Clinton won't even say the words radical Islamic terrorism she won't say 11:17 the words Hillary Clinton she talks tough about my supporters that's what 11:22 she does but she doesn't want to talk about Islamic terrorists she calls the 11:28 patriotic Americans who support our campaign many of them cops and soldiers 11:33 deplorable and irredeemable 11:39 she won't use the same words to describe Islamic extremists who believe in the 11:45 oppression of women gays and people of different faiths but our people you you 11:50 I guess me probably me more than anybody 11:56 according to our but our people she has no problem with Hillary Clinton things 12:03 hard-working patriotic Americans like you are the problem 12:07 she doesn't get it and she doesn't understand how democracy works believe 12:12 me 12:13 public servers are just that they're there to serve you but the only people 12:19 Clinton has ever served are the special address and her donors and I don't have 12:26 you saw her campaign fifty-to-one and advertising fifty-to-one and I think 12:31 we're actually winning people over 50 to 1 12:40 our campaign is about breaking up the special interests monopoly in Washington 12:44 DC 12:45 we're trying to disrupt thank you we're trying to disrupt the collusion between 12:52 the wealthy donors the large corporations and the media executives 12:56 they're all part of the same political establishment they go to the same 13:03 restaurants they attend the same conferences they have the same friends 13:07 and connections they all support the same ideology of globalism that makes 13:13 them rich while shipping your jobs your factories in your wealth all the way out 13:18 to other countries i am not running to be president of the world i'm running to 13:24 be President of the United States and that's what we're going to do 13:36 we're gonna take care of our country Wow look at all the people up there it's a 13:41 big balcony 13:42 hello balcony 13:48 I am for America but specifically i am for America first it's going to be 13:54 America first hasn't happened in a long time together we will rebuild this 14:01 country beyond our greatest dreams that rebuilding begins with American 14:07 manufacturing ohio has lost one third of its manufacturing jobs since the bill 14:14 clinton signed NAFTA disaster which Hillary supported totally we're going to 14:22 renegotiate NAFTA to get a fair deal for our workers and it will be a fair deal 14:27 and if it's not will terminate and we'll start all over again because NAFTA is a 14:32 one-way Road out of our country for our jobs in our money 14:41 daft is devastated manufacturing right here in Ohio and Michigan and 14:46 Pennsylvania and all over New England and in the state of North Carolina where 14:51 I just left right now if Ford builds a car in ohio and exports it to Mexico 14:56 Mexico slaps us with a huge value added tax or a backdoor tariff but before it 15:03 moves its factories to Mexico and then exports a car back to America forgives 15:09 Ford and Mexico works this but mexico through the back will give forward a 15:15 hefty that tax rebate and backdoor export subsidy it makes it impossible 15:22 for our country to compete i don't know how many people just understood what I 15:27 said does anybody understand right because it makes it impossible they made 15:34 a mistake when they negotiated this deal we have different tax systems and Mexico 15:39 is I mean they gotta be laughing this going on for years 15:43 it makes it impossible for our country to compete 15:48 that's why how often you see the factors going the other way then we'll go the 15:51 other way they go so one way road out 15:54 not anymore folks believe me 16:01 crazy crazy you look at that vat tax it's crazy they get it both ways in 16:05 other words they get it both ways and then we're afraid to tax the product 16:10 coming in okay and if we tax the product coming in guess what they wouldn't move 16:14 they wouldn't be leaving because now for it is just announces moving all of its 16:18 small car production all of it to Mexico where they're building among the biggest 16:27 most sophisticated plants anywhere in the world 16:30 not us Ohio has also lost more than 221,000 job since China joined the world 16:38 trade organization another deal push by bill clinton and supported by his wife 16:42 Hillary in November a we can finally close the history book on her legacy of 16:50 failure and turn the page to a bright and shining future 17:00 it will be a new dawn for the American worker starting in 2017 jobs are going 17:10 to start leaving other countries and coming back to us believe me believe me 17:19 that includes apple products we are going to have an immigration system that 17:25 makes sense 17:26 one based on merit skill and promoting the economic interests of American 17:30 workers our tax code which now waste billions and billions of dollars a year 17:36 just in compliance will become simple streamlined and efficient and go way way 17:43 down we're taking those taxes way down way down your taxes are going away there 17:48 and Hillary Clinton i don't know if you know this because they don't talk about 17:53 it 17:54 Hillary Clinton is asking for a major tax increase remember that major 17:59 government will start working again 18:02 fixing things we're going to have this economy work again for you just look at 18:08 my projects in New York white earned run down spaces into new centers of business 18:13 and we have hit such success taking buildings that were failures and made 18:19 them successful made them incredible buildings jobs so many things even an 18:25 ice-skating rink took eight years the city couldn't build it I did it in three 18:29 months okay you know about 18:35 where others only saw problems i saw potential we turned empty lots and empty 18:41 buildings and empty homes into living memories of thousands of workers and 18:45 their families hired thousands and thousands of people and they've done a 18:49 great job for me i can tell you that that's what I want to do for our country 18:54 I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods to failing schools the 18:57 Forgotten stretches of this nation of which there are many and unlock their 19:02 potential for all of our people i made a living for years looking for unused 19:12 spaces and imagining what could be politicians look at blighted 19:19 neighborhoods and offer only excuses they look for one thing they look for 19:25 the votes of people living in the inner cities and then they say we'll see you 19:29 later in four years after the election takes place i look at the same 19:35 neighborhoods and i want to offer solutions and I have offered solutions 19:39 and all you have to do is look at what's happening with the poll numbers with 19:44 african-americans and with Hispanics they are really going up big league 19:50 because they get it 19:54 we spend so much time thinking about how things used to be 19:59 we've stopped thinking about how great things could be all we have to do is 20:03 turn out the doubters the cynics and the naysayers of which we have a lot of them 20:08 and I understand why we have so many because they haven't seen it's been all 20:14 talk no action for so many years by politicians but just remember this 20:18 I'm not a politician thankfully I'm not 20:26 we are a nation of strivers dreamers and believers and that's the spirit that we 20:31 will carry right into November november eight to be specific and we are going to 20:37 have a great great monumental victory it's going to be an amazing day for this 20:44 country 20:45 I don't know if you know it look at crowds like this every auditory of every 20:51 place is sold out thousands of people outside always what we have is a 20:56 movement like they've never seen before they've never seen it many of the 20:59 commentators bill o'reilly many of the commentators said it's one of the great 21:04 political phenomenas of our time but you know what 21:09 to me it's only a phenomena if we win in november eighth otherwise it's not a 21:14 phenomenon we gotta get some of that Bobby Knight stuff in us right 21:21 he won he knew how to win that's for sure 21:25 it's that same spirit of resilience i have seen visiting the flood-ravaged 21:32 towns of Louisiana where Hillary Clinton refuse to go or meeting the incredible 21:38 but hard hit people in cities and towns like flint michigan were just left 21:43 recently that was a rough site to look at flint michigan it's that spirit of 21:50 strength we need to start winning again as a country in this effort no part of 21:56 our country will be left behind when any part of our country hurts 22:01 we all heard 22:06 nationwide nearly four in ten african-american children live in 22:12 poverty including forty-five percent of african-american children under the age 22:17 of six can you believe that 45% we should never accept this level of 22:24 poverty in our country and there is no greater anti-poverty program in the 22:29 world then weíll good jobs but to unlock jobs we must also make 22:40 communities safe crime is rising across this country more than 3,000 people have 22:47 been shot in Chicago since january of this year to the african-american 22:52 community 22:54 I say vote for Donald J Trump i will fixing 23:03 yeah 23:06 can I say honestly what do you have to lose not going to get any worse 23:13 it's terrible the crime

education under our plan every low-income child in our nation will be 23:46 able to attend the private-public magnet or charter school including religious 23:53 schools of their choice i will be your greatest champion in the White House 24:00 Hillary Clinton on the other hand only fights to protect the corrupt political 24:06 establishment out Kevin other she's talking now about immigration and 24:12 schools and education 24:14 she's been there for 30 years she hasn't done anything in upstate New York I have 24:19 to tell you in upstate New York when she was campaigning for the Senate it was 24:25 having a hard time she said she's gonna bring in 200,000 jobs she got elected 24:30 she has done anything it's a disaster area right now and you're gonna have the 24:34 same thing if anything
