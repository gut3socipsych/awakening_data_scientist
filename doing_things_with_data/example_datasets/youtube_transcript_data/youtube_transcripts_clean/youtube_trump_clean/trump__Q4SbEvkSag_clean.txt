they are stolen American lives and to advocate for justice on behalf of all 1:10 american victims we thank you and thank you folks would you have to go through 1:16 as undeliverable I'm honored to be here today and shine a national spotlight on 1:26 a group of victims who have been forced and I mean truly forced into the shadows 1:33 your stories are not featured in the news you have no demonstrators taking to 1:39 the streets in your behalf 1:41 you have no special interest taking up your cause and the politicians ignore 1:49 your cries for help but I never will remember 1:59 yeah 2:02 yeah 2:04 and I've known many of you for a long time now it seems like a long time but 2:09 i'm still here and you're still here right 2:12 still fighting I've met many incredible people during the course of this 2:17 campaign but nothing has moved me more deeply than the time I've spent with the 2:24 families of the remembrance project folks in remembrance by the way are 2:29 doing such an incredible job 2:37 and the strength and the courage that you've shown in your very often lonely 2:43 fight for justice will get there you are the heroes you are and your actions will 2:50 help us to save the next thousand American citizens from losing their 2:55 brothers and sisters and sons and daughters and parents the most 3:01 fundamental duty of government is to protect American lives 3:13 anyone who fails to understand this is not fit to hold public office 3:28 every day our border remains open innocent Americans are needlessly 3:33 victimized and killed every day sanctuary cities are left in place 3:38 innocent Americans are put in harm's way every day we fail to enforce those in a 3:45 day and this is absolutely happening all the time is a day when a loving parent 3:52 is at risk of losing their child and it's happening every single day all 4:01 across this country dining room tables have an empty seat at the family table 4:07 because our government abandoned its duty and failed to enforce its basic 4:13 laws there are a lot of numbers the immigration debate 4:19 I've been talking about it for a long time and obviously people agree with me 4:24 because you see what's happening 4:26 you see the numbers you see the polls you see what's going on at the rallies 4:30 lot of people agree with me almost it seems everybody was almost say what's 4:36 not to agree with but let me give you what's not working 4:44 but let me give you the most important number of all that most important number 4:51 of all is the number of American lives that is acceptable to lose in the name 4:57 of illegal immigration 5:00 let me tell you what that number is zero 5:14 our nation should not accept one lost american line because our country failed 5:21 to enforce its laws what do you tell the mother who just buried her daughter 5:28 because someone was released at the border who should have been sent home 5:34 we should have been imprisoned in another country 5:37 what do you tell the young boy who grow up without a dad because the criminal 5:41 was deported five times what was allowed to keep coming back coming back in 5:48 coming back into our country doing tremendous arm 5:52 what do you tell the wife who's lost her husband because a sanctuary City 5:57 released an illegal immigrant from behind bars this has to end it will end 6:05 if I become president I promise 6:19 yeah 6:21 yeah 6:30 yeah 6:35 thank you thank you i love you 6:45 love everybody in this room special special people not one more American 6:52 life should be given up in the name of open borders 6:56 just look at what happened in the last few days last week it was reported that 7:02 authorities detained an illegal immigrant in the Austin area who is 7:07 responsible for nearly a dozen sexual assaults and had been previously 7:12 reported five times within a three year period earlier this week in Kansas 7:17 Sheriff's Department master deputy was killed 7:22 apparently an illegal immigrant

victims had six children is an Air Force veteran in a high school 8:19 football coach the other victim is a mother and a grandmother when Hillary 8:25 Clinton was Secretary of State the matter of this country and think of this 8:30 think of this matter of this country refusing to take back their deported 8:36 citizen came before Hillary Clinton's desk 8:40 oftentimes many times but she failed to take forceful action and ignore the 8:46 federal law requiring her to suspend Lisa's two countries that don't take 8:51 back their citizens 8:53 she didn't want to get involved politicians politicians according to a 9:02 report from the boston globe from the year 2008 through 2014 nearly 13,000 9:10 criminal aliens were released back into u.s. communities because their home 9:14 countries would not take them back they were too tough 9:20 they were too angry they were too evil then one back and we don't force them 9:28 back 9:29 we want to be nice people we want to be nice and politically correct and they're 9:35 all roaming the streets 9:37 most of these 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch she had the 9:44 power and the duty to stop it cold and she didn't 9:48 now my opponent will never meet with you never meet with you 9:53 no interest you know that because you've been trying for a long time years I've 9:59 been trying for years she will never hear your stories she will never share 10:05 your pain she will only meet with the donors and the special interests and the 10:12 0 / and on the open border advocates her plan calls for total amnesty in the 10:21 first 100 days which means Obamacare social security and medicare for illegal 10:28 immigrants her plan calls 10:33 her plan calls for catch-and-release on the board sanctuary cities ignoring visa 10:40 overstays closing detention centers and a virtual end to immigration enforcement 10:47 in the united states of america Hillary Clinton has even announced that she 10:53 plans to go around congress and implement amnesty by executive order 10:58 violating our Constitution and putting the entire nation in grave peril Hillary 11:07 Clinton is the person and I mean the first person to ever run for the 11:14 presidency of a country effectively proposing to abolish the borders around 11:20 the country that she's supposed to be representing but the media doesn't want 11:27 you to know that so they'll never ask her any questions about her plan won't 11:36 be talking about at the debate which is going to be a very interesting period of 11:42 time 11:52 like casual afford to give Lifetime welfare and entitlements to illegal 11:56 immigrants or how many people will be victimized because of the illegal 12:01 immigrants that will be released from federal custody right at the border or 12:08 inside the border 12:09 she's not asked to explain what you'll say to the American workers who lose 12:13 their jobs when she prints out millions of work permits for those here totally 12:19 against the law 12:21 many of whom have very very substantial problems your cause and your stories are 12:29 ignored by our political establishment because they are determined to keep our 12:35 border open at any cost to them 12:40 your presence is just to inconvenience to other visits an inconvenience but 12:48 help is coming 12:49 tell you 13:00 on November a we're going to win the white house 13:13 and we are going to deliver justice for every American family and every single 13:22 American victim you know what that means you know what that together we will save 13:31 American lives and prevent the next thousand American parents from suffering 13:37 the same fate as the people in this room today their loved ones will not have 13:45 died in vain elite since $MONTH 2013luong figure this since $MONTH 2013 13:59 the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back 14:06 into the United States and its communities 14:09 these are individuals encounter or identified by ice but who were not 14:18 detained or processed for deportation according to the federal government's 14:24 own data there are more than two million convicted criminal illegal immigrants 14:28 inside of the United States right now two million and we wonder why do we have 14:34 such crime why do we have such violence and this is true violence 14:38 this is violence like most people have never even heard of before 14:43 however this figure does not include the many individuals who have committed 14:50 crimes but escaped justice fled the jurisdiction or otherwise never caught 14:56 and many of the folks are in that position where you even sometimes know 15:02 who they are and yet there never caught 15:05 we're going to catch him 15:12 yeah 15:14 many crimes committed by people here illegally remain open cases and yet our 15:20 government knows a lot about the people that didn't but they don't go after 15:25 they've killed people denika laughter at the same time hundreds of individuals 15:32 who have been given visas and reference and think of this 15:37 they've been given visas their refugee admissions into the country subsequently 15:44 were charged with terrorism and nobody does anything about it 15:50 nobody does anything about the most unbelievable thing that I've seen 15:54 that's why I become it's like become a personal passion for me when I see these 15:58 people and there's so many people remember this project there are so many 16:03 people this is a small group a lot of people it's a small group compared to 16:08 what we're talking about the devastation is unbelievable so we're admitting 16:14 people here with no idea of who they are and we don't know very much about we 16:24 don't know what they believe we don't know if they have love in their heart 16:28 for our country or if they have hatred in their heart for our country whether 16:33 it's drugs terrorism or violent trying our government is utterly failing in its 16:38 core mission to defend and protect the people of this country the border patrol 16:46 agents these are incredible people they endorse me first time they've ever 16:51 endorsed a presidential 16:55 they've warned that Hillary Clinton's plan would put the entire country in 17:06 grave danger fully understand they called it radical deeply dangers and 17:13 warned it would trigger an unprecedented national crisis they know they know 17:20 better than any consultant they know better than anybody the border patrol 17:25 agents let's just remember our goal to prevent the next family from suffering 17:31 the same
