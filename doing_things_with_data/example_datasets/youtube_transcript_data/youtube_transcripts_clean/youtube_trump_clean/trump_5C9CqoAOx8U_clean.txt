I went out to Indiana which was supposed to be a state 9:08 that I wasn't going to do well and we wanted a massive landslide by the way 9:12 the evangelicals were so good 9:14 how many evangelicals where the evangelicals where the even so so what 9:25 happens is the evangelicals took me to a point that I never thought we could even 9:31 reach all over the country we did well and I just met by the way I just met all 9:36 look at her look at wow so that's so nice 9:42 that's so nice thank you thank you but in Indiana one of the reasons we want 9:49 one was Bobby night we had Bobby Knight we love Bobby but and we have by the way 9:57 how good is mike pence 10:00 ok how good 10:03 what a job he's doing and he's all over the place he calls me and he's getting 10:09 great crowds and people are loving him we love Mikey did an incredible job as 10:14 the governor of Indiana triple-a bond rating great employment I mean 10:19 everything he's touched he's been terrific and he has been terrific with 10:24 me i want to tell you was so happy so remember 10:28 Governor Mike Pence vice president Mike pent he's doing a job but our companies 10:38 are being taken from us and we're not gonna take it anymore not gonna let it 10:43 for years I've been watching and for years I've been amazed that our 10:46 politicians would not do anything about it 10:51 we're losing some of our best companies taxes are too high but there are a lot 10:56 of other things that are wrong but taxes are too high and here's what's gonna 11:00 happen when a company leaves Florida because they're gonna go to let's say 11:06 Mexico which is by the way 11:09 boom down USA mexico is one of the great wonders of the world what's happening 11:16 well we're going to build the wall believe me folks okay we're going to 11:19 build the world 11:20 we're going to build 11:23 we're going to build the wall 11:38 we're gonna build the wall 11:43 thank you we're gonna build that wall and it's gonna be a big wall and every 11:47 time somebody tries to fight us that wall gets 10 feet higher it's going 11:52 higher 11:53 I and by the way are you ready are you ready are you ready 12:08 who is going to pay for the wall 100-percent 100-person 100-percent hey 12:21 by the way is there any place to be that's better than a friday night in 12:27 Florida at a trump rally right is there any place nobody if no place is no plan 12:36 is no no no 12:39 so a lot of the politicians they come up to me and they go especially initially 12:44 you're only kidding done you're not really gonna build a wall I said of 12:47 course we are they said you can't build a wallace and of course we can in China 12:52 13,000 miles that's the like 13,000 called the Great Wall of China maybe 12:59 nobody's ever heard of it right 13:01 the Great Wall of China this is a serious wall 13:04 this was built without hydraulic equipment this was built without 13:09 caterpillar this was built the old-fashioned way 13,000 miles built 13:16 2,000 years ago and this wall is pretty good we're gonna top it the folks you 13:22 know we can do think we're going to 13:25 but but the politicians would come up to me and they say you know Donald you 13:33 can't build the Wallace said you have to be kidding you have to be kidding 13:36 concrete plank you have to be kidding three cats precast right Bri cares bump 13:44 being done 13:46 keep going no they actually thought it's like it's like I just looked as an 13:56 example we went all over I mean we're going all over the place we're going to 14:00 work i think this is my like 4th speech today I'm doing television all over the 14:05 place 14:06 Governor Mike Huckabee servants so amazing and Pam I want to thank man for 14:12 being here and everybody everybody 14:15 where's Pam where's Pam she's so amazing 14:21 Governor Mike was gonna come out and introduce me he's doing a live show on 14:26 Fox I said do you show on Fox and come out later but Mike Huckabee has been 14:31 incredible 14:33 he's been incredible but the politicians not Mike but the politicians would come 14:40 up and they say so let me ask you your only kidding about the wall and it said 14:45 no no I'm not kidding 14:46 now they become believers then they'd say but you know you can't get Mexico to 14:50 pay can you believe it 14:52 we make so little 14:55 listen listen we have a trade deficit with mexico like more than 60 billion 15:02 dollars a year that's not including the drugs that come in right that's a big 15:06 dumb and we're gonna stop the drugs from coming in and we want people we're going 15:15 to stop it cold by the way and we want people to come into our country but they 15:20 have to come in through a process they have to come in Legally right right 15:25 after have to they're gonna come in Legally and I'll tell you something when 15:35 they come in we're gonna want people that want to be here 15:39 hi folks this place is incredible 15:47 we've got 2,000 people outside trying to get in this place is incredible so not 15:54 you know honestly there is a spirit that we all have that nobody has that nobody 16:01 has when I say make America great again we want something to happen 16:08 we're tired of being we don't want anymore 16:12 we're tired of it we want to win we want to win with our military you know our 16:16 military is totally depleted it's depleted two fighters went down three 16:23 days ago these fighters are exhausted these jet fighters they get parts from 16:30 airplane graveyard that's where they get the parts they're so old they don't make 16:34 the parts anymore 16:36 our military is depleted our vets are taking properly tear care of and we're 16:41 going to take care of our vets we're going to take care of our vets gonna 16:48 take careful 16:51 we're gonna take care we're gonna take care of our vets we take care of people 16:58 that come into our country illegally better than we take care of our vets ok 17:06 so we're going to change it we're going to change a lot of things around but 17:12 they say you will never be able to get Mexico to pay for the wall now recently 17:20 the former president of mexico then sent a fox he went on a major broadcaster I 17:31 think we're seeing an end to be exact 17:33 live television live television and he threw out the f-bomb he said there is no 17:42 way we will ever pay for that and then it was the f-bomb wall I said always in 17:51 trouble 17:52 this guy just said the F bomb on a major network on television life he's in 17:59 trouble nobody ever mentioned can you imagine if i use the f-bomb you know 18:07 what it would be 18:08 I tell people it would be the electric chair if I use the FR and I said always 18:15 in trouble but i'll tell you what i liked about his statement he used to say 18:20 there's no way we will allow the wall to be built now he assumes it's going to be 18:27 built so now he's saying there's no way that they going to pay for the wall 18:30 let me tell you they gonna pay for the wall and they'll be happy about it 18:34 they'll be happy about it they'll be happy you know of Mexico wanted to and I 18:44 have great respect from Mexico I have great respect for its leaders its new 18:48 leader is an amazing person 18:50 we're gonna get along great with Mexico its new leader is a great person an 18:55 amazing person 18:56 the problem is their leadership is much smarter much more cunning much better 19:03 than what we have in our country we have incapable incompetent people they don't 19:11 know what the hell they're doing they don't know what they're doing 19:16 so with Mexico we have such a tremendous trade deficit and when these politicians 19:25 say there's no way that they going to pay for the wall i say fellas we have 19:31 all the cards we have the cards with China we have with China of 505 billion 19:39 dollar-a-year trade deficit unbelievable it's been that way for years it's been 19:45 that way for years it was 200 billion and three hundred billion and 400 19:50 billion add 500 million and what do we have we have changed closing stores 19:57 macy's announcer closing over a hundred stores we have real jobs bad jobs are 20:04 all over the place we have we have a problem we have a statistic 5% doesn't 20:12 exist 20:12 what exists is twenty percent 21% our unemployment rate is through the roof 20:18 the five-percent stuff is made up so that politicians and presidents look 20:24 good if you look for a job and you give up looking for that job because after 20:29 4-5 months you can't find one you are considered statistically employed we 20:35 have hot off again forget now look at this I just got these numbers look at 20:40 this under this is economic failure the obama-clinton economic policies produced 20:50 a 1.2 percent growth growth like just like no growth you know if China goes to 20:59 seven percent they considered a national tragedy where at one point to present 21:05 and going lower and we're going lower 21:08 we're going in the wrong direction because our companies are leaving our 21:12 taxes are too high we don't have the right people representatives and when 21:17 they leave and when they go to Mexico or wherever they go and they fire all of 21:22 their employees in florida and all over this country and they make their product 21:27 and their product is made in Mexico or wherever and they think they're gonna 21:32 sell that product back in the united states and even back in the areas where 21:38 they fired all their employees just tell them there are a hundred percent wrong 21:42 there are repercussions right there are consequences when you leave the United 21:49 States when you fire all your employees when you go to another country and you 21:54 make the product there are consequences now we're gonna have a strong border and 21:59 when they want to sell their product across that border and they think they 22:04 can do it 22:05 not gonna happen anymore not gonna happen not going out they will pay a 22:14 35-percent tax on that product now I watched Hillary today which was really 22:22 boring but that's a hard hard to work hard to watch 22:27 I have to be honest I have an obligation to watch 22:31 fortunately she never goes very long as she wants to go home but I watched 22:36 Hillary today i watch her and she talked about trade now just so you understand 22:42 her husband signed the worst trade deal in the history of maybe the world NAFTA 22:47 signed by builtin maybe the worst trade deal in the history of the world 22:52 certainly of our country and she's going to approve trans-pacific partnership you 22:58 know she called it the gold standard this was the gold standard well let me 23:02 tell you something we she heard me make a speech she heard me right 23:07 goodbye goodbye . goodbye goodbye 23:15 about 23:43 where the hell did he come from 23:59 so 24:12 yeah 24:15 we love you we love you thank you thank you so so she made her speech and i will 24:27 tell you she heard me speaking about TPP trans-pacific partnership and all of a 24:34 sudden she went from its the gold standard does she want to prove it but 24:38 the day after if this ever happened i can imagine all can you imagine losing 24:44 to her 24:45 no can you imagine can you imagine so if she were ever in a position i can't even 24:56 say the word if she were ever in a position to approach you to prove it in 25:01 two minutes 25:02 the governor of Virginia who is a very close friend of his closer even I think 25:06 that bill is there 25:50 not so much for burning much for burning for burning Bernie wanted to go home he 25:58 just wanted to rest he's exhausted he wanted to rest okay you wanted to run 26:04 but we're gonna have a lot of Bernie people you're gonna be surprised 26:08 we're gonna have a lot of Democrats voting for us and we're gonna have a lot 26:12 of Bernie people voting for us and the reason is simple it's because of trade 26:21 because one thing Bernie got right is he knows that we're being ripped off by 26:26 every single company and that wants to come in but by every single country in 26:33 the world we are being ripped off by everybody but especially countries are 26:39 just killing us every single country is just ripping us and he couldn't take it 26:45 anymore the differences he can't do anything about it I can we make great 26:49 trade deals 26:50 we're gonna make great trade I mean we have rebuilt China we have rebuilt China 26:59 you look at Japan you look at what's going on with Japan they send in 27:04 millions of cars we send them week we sent them beef you want to talk about a 27:12 trade imbalance take a look at the numbers on Japan and speaking of that I 27:16 did something a little bit different i actually went out to had some cards MIT 27:21 ok you have to see look look at this 27:27 I'm so proud of these cards look at Neville 27:30 is that 27:34 so here this is what's happening to our country we can't allow people to come in 27:43 from very very hostile and unfriendly territory as we can't do we have enough 27:50 problems so so from Syria with the migration we don't know where these 27:57 people come from there's no way of getting them the documentation is like I 28:03 mean a total there is none 28:05 they say there is it's a sham she just said it's a sham 28:09 it is good word thank you so here is president obama has commuted the 28:16 sentences of more men and women than the past nine president's put together 28:27 and some of these people are bad dudes so you look at it look here's bush is 28:36 Clinton his bush his Reagan we could use ronald reagan even jimmy carter look 28:48 Jimmy Carter his Ford Nixon look look this is and these are people that are 28:57 out there walking the streets 29:00 sleep tight folks sleep tight ok sleep time so that's one how's that pretty 29:07 good chart right well this is just where they get a lot of their money from 25 29:17 million from Saudi Arabia five million from Morocco five million from Oman 29:22 Bahrain algeria guitar lots of money porn intimately look at this one look at 29:35 this one this is a beauty 29:38 this is a beauty number and percent of immigrants in the United States look at 29:43 look at the chart 29:44 okay look at the church not good folks not good 29:49 we want to make America great again folks we want to make America grid 29:57 so here's one 30:01 so here's one and you notice they used a terrible picture of Hillary and I said 30:10 no way you're gonna do that that's not fair use a good picture so they used a 30:15 beautiful picture of Hillary which i think is right right so I'll tell you 30:20 that's the good news the bad news is look look 30:24 the amount of money campaign contributions from hedge funders now I 30:30 know these guys these are guys and women that are tough and rough and don't give 30:38 a damn about you 30:40 they care about that's why you see so many you see so many things happening 30:44 these people so look she's received $MONEY in campaign contributions 48 30:52 million five hundred thousand i received nineteen thousand dollars i don't even 31:00 know who the hell it is 31:08 who isn't 31:10 who isn't nice picture right was a nice good fiction so I received 19,000 I want 31:22 to find out who it is i'll give them their money back what the hell do i need 31:25 that we like you these cards is this great step it's different 31:35 look at this one so what's the American Dream the American dream right this guy 31:41 notes by stand up David David single stand up one of the great builders of 31:45 all time guys loaded he's got so much money he's got so much money but more 31:52 importantly got a great family right 31:54 got a great he's a great guy and a great friend of mine for a long time too long 31:58 we don't want to talk about how long right there 32:00 so here is what's the great thing that everybody wants homeownership right 32:07 that's the American Dream the American dream we want the American dream 32:13 we want you on our home right so here's our owning of the hamsa look at his 32:21 shirt 32:21 this is a disaster so us home ownership it's down more i think they said like 51 32:32 years it's the lowest right 51 years 32:35 look at this Obama great job Obama 32:46 I don't think so that's not too good right not too good 32:51 look at that number it's crashing that numbers said that that is not good and 32:59 then she gives and then she gives his speech today on the economy and by the 33:05 way she said today during her speech that she's gonna try and negotiate trade 33:11 deals you know the only reason she said it is she's been listening to my 33:16 speeches for the last two weeks can't do it 33:21 and assuming she wanted to do it 33:27 her donors the guys to put up to 48 million her donors and the people that 33:32 she has they're not gonna let her do it because they're making a fortune off 33:35 these deals they're making a fortune on trade now I don't know if you see it in 33:41 Florida but I do it's so depressing you go home you turn on the television all 33:46 you do is see phony ads on Donald Trump phony ads they're fun and most of my 33:51 phone you know it's couple hundred percent but i'd say eighty percent don't 33:59 believe him 34:00 they're phony as you know when I was in the primary they did the same thing i 34:03 had so many ads you couldn't see it's like a friend of mine called up 34:09 he lives in florida lives in this area he loves this area but he's going crazy 34:13 says I can't turn on the television without seeing a negative ad about you 34:17 and I know it's not just don't worry about it you got other problems to worry 34:21 about it 34:21 he has no I swear . i want to see just one ivory snow commercial anything 34:27 they've got to get off you 34:29 they've got so many funny they just false and and then my people say you 34:35 really should not comment on those eds I say why not because you don't want to 34:40 talk about them white I want to come and I will tell you they are such false like 34:45 false advertising but in the end I think people know their false but i do I have 34:50 people these are professional people they say don't go back don't talk about 34:55 it i want to talk about it but 34:58 total phony and you know paid for those ads Wall Street and all the people that 35:10 own Hillary Clinton they owner they owner lock stock and barrel 35:15 she will do whatever they want her to do she will look at this one look at this 35:20 one 35:21 ok here's our total national debt 35:25 this was Obama beginning so we've doubled our national debt by the time he 35:31 gets out it'll be more than done right back 35:36 not too good right not too good 35:40 that's it think of it and you know the problem with the National do if he 35:44 doubled it that's not good but we didn't do anything 35:47 our infrastructure is a mess you know would be one thing if we doubled our 35:52 national debt but our roads are in great shape our transportation is amazing 35:56 our airports are the finest in the world all that we did nothing 36:01 he spent almost a trillion dollars and nobody even knows where we spent look we 36:09 have got incompetent at the highest level where hated by everybody i get a 36:16 lot of heat over Russia wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with 36:20 Russia wouldn't be nice 36:22 I mean would that be a nice thing and we work something where we both go in and 36:28 knocked the hell out of Isis instead of us doing with that beer can that be a 36:32 good thing 36:33 right would not be good alright folks I know you're gonna love this one look at 36:44 that look at that look at that sucker huh 36:48 US national debt in trillions so we'll be up to 20 trillion dollars look and we 36:55 got a country that's a mess you know it's one thing to have a lot of debt 37:00 I've always loved it I must be honest with you I don't love it for countries 37:04 but i loved it individually ok things work out good that's great if it don't 37:09 you go really good shit right but for honestly a lot of truth to that but I've 37:15 always loved that I've always loved I understand that I think maybe better 37:19 than anybody and by the way when you're 20 trillion wouldn't be really nice if 37:24 you did have somebody that understood debt 23 but the biggest problem over 37:30 there like a rocket ship going up the biggest problem we have is that you know 37:37 normally you want to get like a bang for your buck great look what we have we 37:43 have our roads are falling apart the airports are third world our airports 37:47 you go to some of these countries and you see airports the likes of which 37:50 you've never seen our airports you leave to buy you leave Qatar you see airports 37:58 that are so unbelievable the head of one of the country's was showing me not so 38:03 long I don't want to embarrass them because he's actually a very good guy 38:07 was showing me their airport and I said magnificent they had everything they had 38:13 health clubs they had this massive airport and I said this is the finest 38:18 I've seen it's unbelievable because no no Donald no no you don't understand 38:22 this is not this is just temporary 38:24 there's our Airport over there he points to the horizon there's like 30 cranes 38:28 building this incredible airport I said you have to be kidding 38:32 and then we fly home to laguardia right 38:37 LaGuardia and Kennedy and LAX right i mean and all of them 38:44 we're like a third-world country 38:47 you look at the bullet trains they have you look at the trains that go 200 and 38:52 250 miles an hour 38:55 magnetic tracks you look at this that we don't have we have the Long Island 38:58 Railroad chug Chuck Chuck have a headache I get a headache 39:04 honestly you know we joke and it's friday night we're having fun but the 39:09 truth is it's pretty sad it's pretty soon as that right 39:14 it's pretty sad so here's the beautiful one 39:18 there's a beautiful so this is now look look we all have a heart and we want to 39:23 take care of people but we can't afford to do this we can't afford so this is 39:28 Syrian refugees admitted to the United States monthly totals since October 2015 39:37 look 39:42 now Orlando knows something about problems because you've suffered greatly 39:51 and i have to tell you your police have done an incredible job 40:08 and you have this whack job coming in and he was here second generation but 40:16 people have to report these people have to report them and they have to report 40:20 them strongly people knew he was sick people knew he was demented but look 40:25 what we have here so this is Syrian refugees being admitted we have a 40:30 president that won't even use the term radical Islamic terrorism won't even use 40:38 the term won't even use the 10 but look what's happened is a bad crooked Hillary 40:47 wants to allow she wants to allow five hundred and fifty percent more people 40:54 from that area to come into our country we don't know where their put you know 41:02 the government puts them all over the place they could be your next-door 41:05 neighbor you know you look at what happened in San Bernardino you look at 41:10 what happened to hear you look at what happened at the world trade center by 41:15 the way at the World Trade Center the great world trade center you look at 41:20 nice couple of weeks ago you look at paris how about Paris 230 people killed 41:27 and remember this our Second Amendment we have to protect our Second Amendment 41:31 we have to put 41:37 that notes1 we've got to protect our Second Amendment and if we don't protect 41:45 our Second Amendment can have big problems because our second amendment is 41:50 so vital so vital to us for safety and for everything else and we've got to get 41:55 out and vote for the right people you gotta get out and vote for the right 41:59 people you know if in san bernardino when these two people one became 42:06 probably radicalized heated by her she came from outside probably radicalized 42:12 them and they went in and they shot and killed 14 people many people wanted 42:17 still in hospital and really badly wounded gravely wounded but they came in 42:22 and they shut now if we had like a couple of people like you like you 42:32 definitely like him 42:35 definitely all I want him stand up when you plz like him I want him 42:42 oh boy 42:48 hundred percent whoa 42:53 they look at him they're gonna say let's get out of here but if we had bullets 42:58 going in the other direction 43:00 number one they probably wouldn't have even come in if they knew there were 43:04 guns where the bullets could travel in the opposite direction but if assuming 43:11 they're not even thinking a little bit which did not the nutjobs then what 43:16 happens is the carnage would be very small by comparison would be very very 43:22 small now Paris a hundred and thirty people killed they have the toughest gun 43:28 laws anywhere in the world the toughest in the world right 43:32 Paris toughest gun laws of the world they say who knows but they walked in 43:38 bham bham get over here 43:41 mom mom killed a hundred and thirty people just massive numbers of people 43:47 still in the hospital will never be the same can never be the same paralyzed 43:53 everything you can imagine now if somebody on the other side had something 43:58 to do they would they had no choice and nothing the bad guys will have the guns 44:02 and the good ones will turn in their guns if they wanted to turn they want to 44:07 obey the law they want to bake so they turned their guns but here's the problem 44:11 now here's the problem if we had protection on the other side of these 44:19 horrible events you know when you have gun-free zones you know that means two 44:23 people to these nuts that means like oh it's open season that's what it means 44:30 that's what it means so we have to protect our second remember you know the 44:35 the National Rifle Association the NRA endorse me very early 44:42 they're fantastic people they're fantastic people Chris and when they 44:51 love America but they endorse me we have to protect our Second Amendment so get 44:57 out there and vote get out there do what you have to do with the both you have to 45:01 call your friends you have to get your friends to vote you have to get out and 45:05 vote and make your vote count or you're going to have a totally decimated I 45:11 totally decimated second of them 45:14 okay so here's the story folks 45:27 thank you 45:32 so here's the start has a stone we don't win anymore we don't want at the border 45:41 we don't want to trade we don't win with a military we can't even beat Isis and 45:47 believe me we're gonna beat Isis going to be Isis you know that Isis is now 45:52 Isis is now and you saw this came out today they tried to hold what they're up 46:00 to 28 countries are in 28 countries they were an 8 a while ago now they're in 28 46:06 countries and they tried to suppress the information i assume as the Obama 46:11 administration and it came out today what's going on it's getting stronger 46:16 its getting bigger and I've been saying that Barack Obama is the founder 46:28 hey 46:29 if he would up folks we should have never been in Iraq we were going to 46:36 destabilize the Middle East 46:38 I said it I was the civilian nobody cares i was a civilian nobody cares we 46:44 should have never been in they should have understood it they've been a 46:46 mistake but we should've never ended the way they ended it by ending it the way 46:52 he ended and he got everybody out and he let him know when and we're leaving and 46:59 they just SAT back they just SAT back and they went in and i'll tell you what 47:07 Barack Obama number one is incompetent and number to remember this number two 47:16 he is the founder in a true sense if you would have state 47:24 oh I didn't want to be there but if he would have kept a relatively small force 47:29 he probably could have prevented Isis from forming 47:34 ok and now you look at what's going on with Isis with this spreading and 47:41 they're probably spreading into our country when we allow that many people 47:47 to come in from that region they're probably spreading into our country look 47:52 at Germany it's a disaster 47:54 look at friends I have friends who go to France and I want to go there anymore 47:58 they say France is no longer friends so here's the story folks we're gonna start 48:05 winning again we're gonna make America great again 48:14 we're gonna win with our military and hopefully we don't have to use it much 48:19 but it is so depleted we have to rebuild it and we are going to knock the hell 48:23 out of Isis how we're gonna do it with others 48:26 we're going to knock the hell out of them we're gonna win for our vets are 48:31 vets are being badly training 48:33 we're gonna win at the border we're gonna have strong borders 48:39 we're gonna win we're gonna win remember this we're gonna win entre we're gonna 48:49 win with education we're gonna win with the Second Amendment we're gonna win 48:54 we're gonna win so much you're gonna get tired of winning the United States will 49:00 become great again we're gonna win win win 49:04 it's going to be America first make America great again thank you everybody 49:12 I love you thank you thank you 49:20 yeah 49:21 yeah 49:25 yeah
