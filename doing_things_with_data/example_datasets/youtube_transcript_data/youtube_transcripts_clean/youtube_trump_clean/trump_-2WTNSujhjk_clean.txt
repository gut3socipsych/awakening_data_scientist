and don't know what 8:07 they're doing 8:08 I love these great I have thousands and thousands of hispanics we're going to 8:13 Nevada I lead a lead with Hispanics are leading in every poll with Hispanics 8:19 they love me I love them 8:21 the problem is the problem is that the leaders of these countries whether it's 8:27 Mexico and Japan or Vietnam which is just doing a big number now all of a 8:31 sudden we're in particular that's the big one the greatest abuse of the 8:37 country that I think I've ever seen financially China what they've done to 8:41 us is the greatest single theft in the history of the world they've taken a 8:45 jobs a pic get our money they've got everything we bring in our jobs back 8:50 folks were bringing jobs back to back 8:55 and I we've had so many we've had so many incredible endorsements and to me 9:01 getting the greatest businesspeople to endorse me is very important Carl Icahn 9:05 interest me so many others have endorsed me and we're going to put these great 9:09 business people in charge and when china wants to come and negotiate negotiate 9:16 not with the political hack which is what they have now taken to negotiate 9:21 with the best business minds in the world and we have in this country 9:28 so we're going to do a lot of beautiful work with a determinate Obamacare it's 9:35 going to be terminated its going to be repealed and it's going to be replaced 9:41 and you can have much better health care in a much smaller cause because 9:45 Obamacare if you look look at the increases in your Obamacare 25 35 45 9:52 even 55% it's dad it's not working we're gonna go to a plan that's going to be so 9:59 much better and so much less expensive so second amendment by the way this is a 10:07 room 10:08 loves the Second Amendment thank you fellows this is the room 10:12 loves and cherishes the second amendment we are going to protect our second 10:22 is God we are getting rid of Common Core we're bringing to a local level in this 10:35 community every time I see him they want education locally that parents the 10:41 teachers they wanted to they don't want bureaucrats in washington telling them 10:45 how to educate their children we spend as the nation more for education per 10:54 pupil than any other nation in the world 10:58 not even close more per pupil second place doesn't even exist so different 11:04 and yet out of 30 countries were ranked number thirty you have giant you have 11:10 Norway Sweden Denmark and then you have number thirty the United States so we 11:17 spend the most and where the bottom of the heap not going to happen anymore 11:21 it's not going to happen and we are going to build our military which I 11:30 thank because a number of the people came down in a number of the pundits and 11:33 watching tonight we love our military 11:39 we love our military and by the way we love our police our police our police 11:48 they are not being treated properly 11:54 we're going to build our military so big so good so strong so powerful that 12:00 nobody is ever gonna mess with us folks at we're going to buy we're going to buy 12:06 the equipment that are generals are soldiers that everybody that's in the 12:10 know what we're not buying equipment that sells because they have political 12:15 well because they take campaign and they give campaign contributions we are going 12:20 to get the equipment that they want not the equipment that they're told to have 12:24 by senators and congressmen in Washington Reagan at break 12:28 equip and the reason I could say that is I'm self funding my campaign I'm not 12:36 getting millions of dollars from all of these 12:40 I'm not getting millions of dollars from all of these special interests and 12:45 lobbyists and donors that once they get it they literally do whatever the 12:50 politicians want that's not gonna happen and we're going to take care of our vets 12:55 we love our vets and their being terribly with take care of so
