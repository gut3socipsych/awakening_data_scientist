###Doing things with R

The "Doing Things with R" (DTR) files contain scripts using various base R tools, installed packages, and helper functions for getting, handling, and analyzing (with visualization) data.  The DTR scripts are a work in progress and are often changed are modified for various reasons (e.g. updated packages, improved coding, etc.).  

Feel free to use the code in these files for you own use.  However, I recommend that you copy and paste the raw code rather than using methods such as the source() function that creates a direct link to the code page because I often update the code found in these files and/or move files around in this repository which may cause errors with direct links to specific pages.  

Also, please contact me at anytime if you have any questions or feedback about the code presented here.
